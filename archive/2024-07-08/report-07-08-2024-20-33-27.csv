Then, we shouldrather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of theGT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref longenough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is releasedand the GT parked.I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() froma dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by abug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's activeintel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on thatintel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as theVMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goesidle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, useasync variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),    - using async variant of _put(),    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and    there is no other good place for that.

This attack requires a user to use a terminal application that supports the translation of ANSI escape codes to read the malicious log file locally in the vulnerable terminal, and to perform additional user interaction to exploit.Universal Forwarder versions 9.1.0.1, 9.0.5, 8.2.11, and lower can be vulnerable in situations where they have management services active and accessible over the network. Universal Forwarder versions 9.0.x and 9.1.x bind management services to the local machine and are not vulnerable in this specific configuration. See SVD-2022-0605 for more information. Universal Forwarder versions 9.1 use Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for communication, which further reduces the potential attack surface.The vulnerability does not directly affect Splunk Enterprise or Universal Forwarder.

CVE-2024-32962,5.8,Node.js,"xml-crypto is an xml digital signature and encryption library for Node.js. In affected versions the default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of the w3 xmldsig-core-20080610 spec. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />`. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes.  An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element.

CVE-2024-5535,5.2,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with anempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents tobe sent to the peer.Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequencessuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issuecould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sentto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applicationsthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list ofsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally neverbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur byaccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the callingapplication.The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLSapplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised andis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly morewidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list ofprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returnsthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in theclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns thefirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlapbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto iscalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition andreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reportsthat there was no overlap in the lists).This function is typically called from a server side application callback forALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the listof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero inlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should nevernormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if theSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the listsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then theapplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application hasaccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and hasaccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_lenparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap""response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then itwill be vulnerable to this problem.In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically selecta protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocolin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comesfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with aclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If theapplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss ofconfidentiality will occur.This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are mostlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is notwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making activeexploitation unlikely.The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases ofOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when theybecome available.",2024-07-03T02:09:04.140,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-5535

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. The file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Word software.Two possible email attack scenarios exist for this vulnerability:With the first email attack scenario, an attacker could send a specially crafted email message to the user and wait for the user to click on the message. When the message renders via Microsoft Word in the Outlook Preview Pane, an attack could be triggered.With the second scenario, an attacker could attach a specially crafted file to an email, send it to a user, and convince them to open it.In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability.

And that in turn fixes the moduleunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU referenceuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts thelast reference to the KVM module.Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item offthe completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as thework will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waitingon the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for thework to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a verysmall delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes anew request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so theremaining work is really just:        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);        mmput(mm);and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU isstill alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with ""wakeup all""work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in aworkqueue.

SMM hasan entirely different set of memslots, and so the initial lookup can finda memslot (SMM=0) and then explode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1).  general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]  CPU: 1 PID: 8410 Comm: syz-executor382 Not tainted 5.13.0-rc5-syzkaller #0  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/01/2011  RIP: 0010:__gfn_to_rmap arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:935 [inline]  RIP: 0010:gfn_to_rmap+0x2b0/0x4d0 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:947  Code: <42> 80 3c 20 00 74 08 4c 89 ff e8 f1 79 a9 00 4c 89 fb 4d 8b 37 44  RSP: 0018:ffffc90000ffef98 EFLAGS: 00010246  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff888015b9f414 RCX: ffff888019669c40  RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: 0000000000000001  RBP: 0000000000000001 R08: ffffffff811d9cdb R09: ffffed10065a6002  R10: ffffed10065a6002 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: dffffc0000000000  R13: 0000000000000003 R14: 0000000000000001 R15: 0000000000000000  FS:  000000000124b300(0000) GS:ffff8880b9b00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000028e31000 CR4: 00000000001526e0  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400  Call Trace:   rmap_add arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:965 [inline]   mmu_set_spte+0x862/0xe60 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:2604   __direct_map arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:2862 [inline]   direct_page_fault+0x1f74/0x2b70 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:3769   kvm_mmu_do_page_fault arch/x86/kvm/mmu.h:124 [inline]   kvm_mmu_page_fault+0x199/0x1440 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:5065   vmx_handle_exit+0x26/0x160 arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:6122   vcpu_enter_guest+0x3bdd/0x9630 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9428   vcpu_run+0x416/0xc20 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9494   kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x4e8/0xa40 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9722   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x70f/0xbb0 arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:3460   vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]   __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:1069 [inline]   __se_sys_ioctl+0xfb/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:1055   do_syscall_64+0x3f/0xb0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:47   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae  RIP: 0033:0x440ce9",2024-07-03T01:37:24.797,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47230
