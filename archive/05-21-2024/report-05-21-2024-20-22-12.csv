CVE-2018-11567,1.4,Amazon,"Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill. The reprompt feature is designed so that if Alexa does not receive an input within 8 seconds, the device can speak a reprompt, then wait an additional 8 seconds for input; if the user still does not respond, the microphone is then turned off. The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard (""gibberish"") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range.

We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do.

Thisfixes a bug where KVM effectively corrupts guest memory during livemigration by writing to guest memory without informing userspace that thepage is dirty.Marking the page dirty got unintentionally dropped when KVM's emulatedCMPXCHG was converted to do a user access.  Before that, KVM explicitlymapped the guest page into kernel memory, and marked the page dirty duringthe unmap phase.Mark the page dirty even if the CMPXCHG fails, as the old data is writtenback on failure, i.e. the page is still written.  The value written isguaranteed to be the same because the operation is atomic, but KVM's ABIis that all writes are dirty logged regardless of the value written.

Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can't do anything about a manager running out of memory and not being able to add new legitimate nodes to the system. This is merely a resource provisioning issue, and definitely not a CVE worthy vulnerability.",2024-05-17T01:10:42.820,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2016-6595
CVE-2020-11710,5.9,Docker,"An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.",2024-05-17T01:41:41.890,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-11710

This privileged helper tool is installed as a LaunchDaemon and implements an XPC service. The XPC service is responsible for handling new VPN connection operations via the main PrivateVPN application. The privileged helper tool creates new VPN connections by executing the openvpn binary located in the /Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources directory. The openvpn binary can be overwritten by the default user, which allows an attacker that has already installed malicious software as the default user to replace the binary. When a new VPN connection is established, the privileged helper tool will launch this malicious binary, thus allowing an attacker to execute code as the root user.

CVE-2024-35873,NA,VS Code,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: Fix vector state restore in rt_sigreturn()The RISC-V Vector specification states in ""Appendix D: CallingConvention for Vector State"" [1] that ""Executing a system call causesall caller-saved vector registers (v0-v31, vl, vtype) and vstart tobecome unspecified."". In the RISC-V kernel this is called ""discardingthe vstate"".Returning from a signal handler via the rt_sigreturn() syscall, vectordiscard is also performed. However, this is not an issue since thevector state should be restored from the sigcontext, and therefore notcare about the vector discard.The ""live state"" is the actual vector register in the running context,and the ""vstate"" is the vector state of the task. A dirty live state,means that the vstate and live state are not in synch.When vectorized user_from_copy() was introduced, an bug sneaked in atthe restoration code, related to the discard of the live state.An example when this go wrong:  1. A userland application is executing vector code  2. The application receives a signal, and the signal handler is     entered.  3. The application returns from the signal handler, using the     rt_sigreturn() syscall.  4. The live vector state is discarded upon entering the     rt_sigreturn(), and the live state is marked as ""dirty"", indicating     that the live state need to be synchronized with the current     vstate.  5. rt_sigreturn() restores the vstate, except the Vector registers,     from the sigcontext  6. rt_sigreturn() restores the Vector registers, from the sigcontext,     and now the vectorized user_from_copy() is used. The dirty live     state from the discard is saved to the vstate, making the vstate     corrupt.  7. rt_sigreturn() returns to the application, which crashes due to     corrupted vstate.Note that the vectorized user_from_copy() is invoked depending on thevalue of CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_V_UCOPY_THRESHOLD. Default is 768, whichmeans that vlen has to be larger than 128b for this bug to trigger.The fix is simply to mark the live state as non-dirty/clean priorperforming the vstate restore.",2024-05-20T13:00:04.957,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35873

CVE-2023-52659,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/mm: Ensure input to pfn_to_kaddr() is treated as a 64-bit typeOn 64-bit platforms, the pfn_to_kaddr() macro requires that the inputvalue is 64 bits in order to ensure that valid address bits don't getlost when shifting that input by PAGE_SHIFT to calculate the physicaladdress to provide a virtual address for.One such example is in pvalidate_pages() (used by SEV-SNP guests), wherethe GFN in the struct used for page-state change requests is a 40-bitbit-field, so attempts to pass this GFN field directly intopfn_to_kaddr() ends up causing guest crashes when dealing with addressesabove the 1TB range due to the above.Fix this issue with SEV-SNP guests, as well as any similar cases thatmight cause issues in current/future code, by using an inline function,instead of a macro, so that the input is implicitly cast to theexpected 64-bit input type prior to performing the shift operation.While it might be argued that the issue is on the caller side, otherarchs/macros have taken similar approaches to deal with instances likethis, such as ARM explicitly casting the input to phys_addr_t:  e48866647b48 (""ARM: 8396/1: use phys_addr_t in pfn_to_kaddr()"")A C inline function is even better though.[ mingo: Refined the changelog some more & added __always_inline. ]",2024-05-17T18:35:35.070,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-52659

The latter mapping is not active yet at this point, and sosymbol references that rely on it will fault.Given that the core kernel is built without -fPIC, symbol references aretypically emitted as absolute, and so any such references occuring inthe early startup code will therefore crash the kernel.While an attempt was made to work around this for the early SEV/SMEstartup code, by forcing RIP-relative addressing for certain globalSEV/SME variables via inline assembly (see snp_cpuid_get_table() forexample), RIP-relative addressing must be pervasively enforced forSEV/SME global variables when accessed prior to page table fixups.__startup_64() already handles this issue for select non-SEV/SME globalvariables using fixup_pointer(), which adjusts the pointer relative to a`physaddr` argument. To avoid having to pass around this `physaddr`argument across all functions needing to apply pointer fixups, introducea macro RIP_RELATIVE_REF() which generates a RIP-relative reference toa given global variable. It is used where necessary to forceRIP-relative accesses to global variables.For backporting purposes, this patch makes no attempt at cleaning upother occurrences of this pattern, involving either inline asm orfixup_pointer(). Those will be addressed later.

CVE-2024-35803,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/efistub: Call mixed mode boot services on the firmware's stackNormally, the EFI stub calls into the EFI boot services using the stackthat was live when the stub was entered. According to the UEFI spec,this stack needs to be at least 128k in size - this might seem large butall asynchronous processing and event handling in EFI runs from the samestack and so quite a lot of space may be used in practice.In mixed mode, the situation is a bit different: the bootloader callsthe 32-bit EFI stub entry point, which calls the decompressor's 32-bitentry point, where the boot stack is set up, using a fixed allocationof 16k. This stack is still in use when the EFI stub is started in64-bit mode, and so all calls back into the EFI firmware will be usingthe decompressor's limited boot stack.Due to the placement of the boot stack right after the boot heap, anystack overruns have gone unnoticed. However, commit  5c4feadb0011983b (""x86/decompressor: Move global symbol references to C code"")moved the definition of the boot heap into C code, and now the bootstack is placed right at the base of BSS, where any overruns willcorrupt the end of the .data section.While it would be possible to work around this by increasing the size ofthe boot stack, doing so would affect all x86 systems, and mixed modesystems are a tiny (and shrinking) fraction of the x86 installed base.So instead, record the firmware stack pointer value when entering fromthe 32-bit firmware, and switch to this stack every time a EFI bootservice call is made.",2024-05-17T18:35:35.070,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35803
