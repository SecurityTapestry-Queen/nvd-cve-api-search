CVE-2023-48795,3.6,Apache,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

CVE-2022-48644,NA,Atom,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: taprio: avoid disabling offload when it was never enabledIn an incredibly strange API design decision, qdisc->destroy() getscalled even if qdisc->init() never succeeded, not exclusively sincecommit 87b60cfacf9f (""net_sched: fix error recovery at qdisc creation""),but apparently also earlier (in the case of qdisc_create_dflt()).The taprio qdisc does not fully acknowledge this when it attempts fulloffload, because it starts off with q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID intaprio_init(), then it replaces q->flags with TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_FLAGSparsed from netlink (in taprio_change(), tail called from taprio_init()).But in taprio_destroy(), we call taprio_disable_offload(), and thisdetermines what to do based on FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED(q->flags).But looking at the implementation of FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED()(a bitwise check of bit 1 in q->flags), it is invalid to call this macroon q->flags when it contains TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, because that is setto U32_MAX, and therefore FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED() will return true onan invalid set of flags.As a result, it is possible to crash the kernel if user space forces anerror between setting q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, and the callingof taprio_enable_offload(). This is because drivers do not expect theoffload to be disabled when it was never enabled.The error that we force here is to attach taprio as a non-root qdisc,but instead as child of an mqprio root qdisc:$ tc qdisc add dev swp0 root handle 1: \	mqprio num_tc 8 map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \	queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 hw 0$ tc qdisc replace dev swp0 parent 1:1 \	taprio num_tc 8 map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \	queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 base-time 0 \	sched-entry S 0x7f 990000 sched-entry S 0x80 100000 \	flags 0x0 clockid CLOCK_TAIUnable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address fffffffffffffff8[fffffffffffffff8] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMPCall trace: taprio_dump+0x27c/0x310 vsc9959_port_setup_tc+0x1f4/0x460 felix_port_setup_tc+0x24/0x3c dsa_slave_setup_tc+0x54/0x27c taprio_disable_offload.isra.0+0x58/0xe0 taprio_destroy+0x80/0x104 qdisc_create+0x240/0x470 tc_modify_qdisc+0x1fc/0x6b0 rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x12c/0x390 netlink_rcv_skb+0x5c/0x130 rtnetlink_rcv+0x1c/0x2cFix this by keeping track of the operations we made, and undo theoffload only if we actually did it.I've added ""bool offloaded"" inside a 4 byte hole between ""int clockid""and ""atomic64_t picos_per_byte"".

The chunking of responses is helpful for mitigating memory exhaustion on the Mealie server, however a single request to an arbitrarily large external file (e.g. a Debian ISO) is often sufficient to completely saturate a CPU core assigned to the Mealie container.

CVE-2024-32481,1.4,Ethereum,"Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.",2024-04-25T17:24:59.967,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-32481

The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.",2024-04-23T07:15:42.550,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-40735

CVE-2023-45288,NA,Endpoint,"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.",2024-04-25T06:15:52.357,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-45288

Mealie will attempt to retrieve this file in whole. If it can be retrieved, it may be stored on the file system in whole (leading to possible disk consumption), however the more likely scenario given resource limitations is that the container will OOM during file retrieval if the target file size is greater than the allocated memory of the container. At best this can be used to force the container to infinitely restart due to OOM (if so configured in `docker-compose.yml), or at worst this can be used to force the Mealie container to crash and remain offline. In the event that the file can be retrieved, the lack of rate limiting on this endpoint also permits an attacker to generate ongoing requests to any target of their choice, potentially contributing to an external-facing DoS attack.

CVE-2023-39325,3.6,Golang,"A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",2024-04-28T04:15:09.877,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-39325

CVE-2023-6129,4.2,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementationcontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications runningon PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MACalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with variousapplication dependent consequences.The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL forPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different orderthan they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registersare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies thatTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. Howeverwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affectedby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.",2024-04-26T09:15:08.910,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-6129

Where the key thatis being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may leadto a Denial of Service.When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and thiscomputation completes quickly.

CVE-2024-31497,NA,SSH,"In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services.
