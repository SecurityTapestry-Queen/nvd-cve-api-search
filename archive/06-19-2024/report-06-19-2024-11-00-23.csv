CVE-2024-37293,6.0,AWS,"The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is a framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization. ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in AWS Organizations while taking advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeCommit to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup. ADF contains a bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges.Prior to version 4.0.0, the bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to the `sts:AssumeRole` operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default, this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations, providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS Account. The patches for this issue are included in `aws-deployment-framework` version 4.0.0.As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts.",2024-06-13T18:36:09.013,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-37293

CVE-2024-37164,4.7,Amazon,"Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. CVAT allows users to supply custom endpoint URLs for cloud storages based on Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Starting in version 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.14.3, an attacker with a CVAT account can exploit this feature by specifying URLs whose host part is an intranet IP address or an internal domain name. By doing this, the attacker may be able to probe the network that the CVAT backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition, if there is a web server on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows authentication with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the attacker may be able to create a cloud storage linked to this server. They may then be able to list files on the server; extract files from the server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable annotations or datasets, task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups. The exact capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is configured. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In this release, the existing SSRF mitigation measures are applied to requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP addresses prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available. One may use network security solutions such as virtual networks or firewalls to prohibit network access from the CVAT backend to unrelated servers on your internal network and/or require authentication for access to internal servers.",2024-06-13T18:35:19.777,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-37164

CVE-2017-9861,5.9,Exploit,"An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SIP implementation does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet injection attacks, and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able to successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device, stop it from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP vulnerabilities, or find sensitive information from the SIP communications. Furthermore, because the SIP communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. For example, passwords can be extracted. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork.

This stack-protector failure only applies to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized local variables.The default behavior when the stack-protector detects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in controlled loss of availability.

CVE-2023-5123,5.9,Endpoint,"The JSON datasource plugin ( https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/ ) is a Grafana Labs maintained plugin for Grafana that allows for retrieving and processing JSON data from a remote endpoint (including a specific sub-path) configured by an administrator. Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter, it was possible to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path.                                         This means that if the datasource was configured by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ ), it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues queries containing path traversal characters, which would in turn cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/) .In the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana instance itself, this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe, as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials, resulting in the potential for privilege escalation, hence the high score for this vulnerability.",2024-06-18T10:15:09.937,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-5123

CVE-2024-37904,3.6,GitHub,"Minder is an open source Software Supply Chain Security Platform. Minder's Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First, it sets the `CloneOptions`, specifying the url, the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem, to which it clones and Finally, it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack: A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions: 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones, 2. Minder does not enforce a size limit to the repository, 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",2024-06-18T17:15:52.337,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-37904

This means the underlyingdoubly-linked list is temporarily inconsistent, page->prev->next orpage->next->prev might not be equal back to page for some page in thering buffer.The resize operation in ring_buffer_resize() can be invoked in parallel.It calls rb_check_pages() which can detect the described inconsistencyand stop further tracing:[  190.271762] ------------[ cut here ]------------[  190.271771] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6186 at kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:1467 rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0[  190.271789] Modules linked in: [...][  190.271991] Unloaded tainted modules: intel_uncore_frequency(E):1 skx_edac(E):1[  190.272002] CPU: 1 PID: 6186 Comm: cmd.sh Kdump: loaded Tainted: G            E      6.9.0-rc6-default #5 158d3e1e6d0b091c34c3b96bfd99a1c58306d79f[  190.272011] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552c-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014[  190.272015] RIP: 0010:rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0[  190.272023] Code: [...][  190.272028] RSP: 0018:ffff9c37463abb70 EFLAGS: 00010206[  190.272034] RAX: ffff8eba04b6cb80 RBX: 0000000000000007 RCX: ffff8eba01f13d80[  190.272038] RDX: ffff8eba01f130c0 RSI: ffff8eba04b6cd00 RDI: ffff8eba0004c700[  190.272042] RBP: ffff8eba0004c700 R08: 0000000000010002 R09: 0000000000000000[  190.272045] R10: 00000000ffff7f52 R11: ffff8eba7f600000 R12: ffff8eba0004c720[  190.272049] R13: ffff8eba00223a00 R14: 0000000000000008 R15: ffff8eba067a8000[  190.272053] FS:  00007f1bd64752c0(0000) GS:ffff8eba7f680000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000[  190.272057] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[  190.272061] CR2: 00007f1bd6662590 CR3: 000000010291e001 CR4: 0000000000370ef0[  190.272070] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000[  190.272073] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400[  190.272077] Call Trace:[  190.272098]  <TASK>[  190.272189]  ring_buffer_resize+0x2ab/0x460[  190.272199]  __tracing_resize_ring_buffer.part.0+0x23/0xa0[  190.272206]  tracing_resize_ring_buffer+0x65/0x90[  190.272216]  tracing_entries_write+0x74/0xc0[  190.272225]  vfs_write+0xf5/0x420[  190.272248]  ksys_write+0x67/0xe0[  190.272256]  do_syscall_64+0x82/0x170[  190.272363]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e[  190.272373] RIP: 0033:0x7f1bd657d263[  190.272381] Code: [...][  190.272385] RSP: 002b:00007ffe72b643f8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001[  190.272391] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 00007f1bd657d263[  190.272395] RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000555a6eb538e0 RDI: 0000000000000001[  190.272398] RBP: 0000555a6eb538e0 R08: 000000000000000a R09: 0000000000000000[  190.272401] R10: 0000555a6eb55190 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007f1bd6662500[  190.272404] R13: 0000000000000002 R14: 00007f1bd6667c00 R15: 0000000000000002[  190.272412]  </TASK>[  190.272414] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---Note that ring_buffer_resize() calls rb_check_pages() only if the parenttrace_buffer has recording disabled.

CVE-2024-35225,6.0,JavaScript,"Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes alongside their notebook server and provide authenticated web access to them. Versions of 3.x prior to 3.2.4 and 4.x prior to 4.2.0 have a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The `/proxy` endpoint accepts a `host` path segment in the format `/proxy/<host>`. When this endpoint is called with an invalid `host` value, `jupyter-server-proxy` replies with a response that includes the value of `host`, without sanitization [2]. A third-party actor can leverage this by sending a phishing link with an invalid `host` value containing custom JavaScript to a user. When the user clicks this phishing link, the browser renders the response of `GET /proxy/<host>`, which runs the custom JavaScript contained in `host` set by the actor. As any arbitrary JavaScript can be run after the user clicks on a phishing link, this issue permits extensive access to the user's JupyterLab instance for an actor. Patches are included in versions 4.2.0 and 3.2.4. As a workaround, server operators who are unable to upgrade can disable the `jupyter-server-proxy` extension.",2024-06-13T18:36:09.013,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35225

CVE-2024-38351,2.5,MFA,"Pocketbase is an open source web backend written in go. In affected versions a malicious user may be able to compromise other user accounts. In order to be exploited users must have both OAuth2 and Password auth methods enabled. A possible attack scenario could be: 1. a malicious actor register with the targeted user's email (it is unverified), 2. at some later point in time the targeted user stumble on your app and decides to sign-up with OAuth2 (_this step could be also initiated by the attacker by sending an invite email to the targeted user_), 3. on successful OAuth2 auth we search for an existing PocketBase user matching with the OAuth2 user's email and associate them, 4. because we haven't changed the password of the existing PocketBase user during the linking, the malicious actor has access to the targeted user account and will be able to login with the initially created email/password. To prevent this for happening we now reset the password for this specific case if the previously created user wasn't verified (an exception to this is if the linking is explicit/manual, aka. when you send `Authorization:TOKEN` with the OAuth2 auth call). Additionally to warn existing users we now send an email alert in case the user has logged in with password but has at least one OAuth2 account linked. The flow will be further improved with ongoing refactoring and we will start sending emails for ""unrecognized device"" logins (OTP and MFA is already implemented and will be available with the next v0.23.0 release in the near future). For the time being users are advised to update to version 0.22.14. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",2024-06-18T17:15:52.777,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-38351

This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a denial of service attack by exhausting server CPU resources through repeated TLS renegotiations. This impacts the availability of services running on the affected server, posing a significant risk to operational stability and security.

CVE-2024-35235,3.6,Ubuntu,"OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.8 and earlier, when starting the cupsd server with a Listen configuration item pointing to a symbolic link, the cupsd process can be caused to perform an arbitrary chmod of the provided argument, providing world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as root, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor context, on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files modifiable by the cupsd process. In that specific case it was found to be possible to turn the configuration of the Listen argument into full control over the cupsd.conf and cups-files.conf configuration files. By later setting the User and Group arguments in cups-files.conf, and printing with a printer configured by PPD with a `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` argument, arbitrary user and group (not root) command execution could be achieved, which can further be used on Ubuntu systems to achieve full root command execution.

Itcompiles, that's all I know.  I'll appreciate some review and testing fromacrn folks.Patch #2+#3 improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, addingmore sanity checks, and improving the documentation.  Gave it a quick teston x86-64 using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte().This patch (of 3):We currently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerousfollow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage.(1) We're not checking PTE write permissions.Maybe we should simply always require pte_write() like we do forpin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so let's check forACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now.(2) We're not rejecting refcounted pages.As we are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages isdangerous and can result in use-after-free. Let's make sure to reject them.(3) We are only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range.We only lookup a single PTE, but memmap->len may span a larger area.Let's loop over all involved PTEs and make sure the PFN range isactually contiguous. Reject everything else: it couldn't have workedeither way, and rather made use access PFNs we shouldn't be accessing.",2024-06-19T14:15:20.893,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-38610
