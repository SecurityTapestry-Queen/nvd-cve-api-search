      <td>Cisco is providing an update for the ongoing investigation into observed exploitation of the web UI feature in Cisco IOS XE Software. We are updating the list of fixed releases and adding the Software Checker. Our investigation has determined that the actors exploited two previously unknown issues. The attacker first exploited CVE-2023-20198 to gain initial access and issued a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password combination. This allowed the user to log in with normal user access. The attacker then exploited another component of the web UI feature, leveraging the new local user to elevate privilege to root and write the implant to the file system. Cisco has assigned CVE-2023-20273 to this issue. CVE-2023-20198 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 10.0. CVE-2023-20273 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 7.2. Both of these CVEs are being tracked by CSCwh87343.</td>

This can be exploited for remote code execution (RCE), for instance if the file written outside the working tree is a git filter that gets executed on a subsequent git command.The issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The user performing the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git configuration.Setting git configuration option core.symlinks = falseÂ before checking out avoids the problem.The issue was fixed in Eclipse JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via  Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/ Â and  repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ .The JGit maintainers would like to thank RyotaK for finding and reporting this issue.</td>

      <td>A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.</td>

When copying or archiving symlinked files, Gradle resolves them but applies the permissions of the symlink itself instead of the permissions of the linked file to the resulting file. This leads to files having too much permissions given that symlinks usually are world readable and writeable. While it is unlikely this results in a direct vulnerability for the impacted build, it may open up attack vectors depending on where build artifacts end up being copied to or un-archived. In versions 7.6.3, 8.4 and above, Gradle will now properly use the permissions of the file pointed at by the symlink to set permissions of the copied or archived file.</td>

      <td>capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for Capsule kubernetes multi-tenancy framework. A bug in the RoleBinding reflector used by `capsule-proxy` gives ServiceAccount tenant owners the right to list Namespaces of other tenants backed by the same owner kind and name. For example consider two tenants `solar` and `wind`. Tenant `solar`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `solar`. Tenant `wind`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `wind`. The Tenant owner `solar` would be able to list the namespaces of the Tenant `wind` and vice-versa, although this is not correct. The bug introduces an exfiltration vulnerability since allows the listing of Namespace resources of other Tenants, although just in some specific conditions: 1. `capsule-proxy` runs with the `--disable-caching=false` (default value: `false`) and 2. Tenant owners are ServiceAccount, with the same resource name, but in different Namespaces. This vulnerability doesn't allow any privilege escalation on the outer tenant Namespace-scoped resources, since the Kubernetes RBAC is enforcing this. This issue has been addressed in version 0.4.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>

Starting in version 0.6.1 and prior to version 0.7.0, if a KernelSU installed device is infected with a malware whose app signing block specially constructed, it can take over root privileges on the device.

In addition to the actual signature upgrade that has been fixed (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V3), there is also the problem of actual signature downgrading (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V1). Find a condition in the signature verification logic that will cause the signature not to be found error, and KernelSU does not implement the same conditions, so KSU thinks there is a V2 signature, but the APK signature verification actually uses the V1 signature.

      <td>Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0).</td>

      <td>Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key andinitialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncationor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() orEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed afterthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,via the "keylen" parameter or the IV length, via the "ivlen" parameter,within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentiallycausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphersand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result inloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38Dsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES inGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV willproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memoryexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as securitycritical.Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operationand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely thatapplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing sincedecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarlyvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application beingvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable thenthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed thisissue as Moderate severity overall.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this becausethe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.</td>

Likewise, applicationsthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained froman untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is thereforevulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively largeP, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.An application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() andsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could bevulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number ofother OpenSSL functions.

Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives.
