After analyzingthe implementation of fec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should havethe same issue.

While the verifier performs a number of safetychecks, it misses to reject unprivileged programs where R0 contains a pointer asold value.Through brute-forcing it takes about ~16sec on my machine to leak a kernel pointerwith BPF_CMPXCHG. The PoC is basically probing for kernel addresses by storing theguessed address into the map slot as a scalar, and using the map value pointer asR0 while SRC_REG has a canary value to detect a matching address.Fix it by checking R0 for pointers, and reject if that's the case for unprivilegedprograms.</td>

It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct; it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network. This means if you have PATROL Agent installed on a high value target (domain controller), you can use a low privileged domain user to authenticate with PatrolCli and then connect to the domain controller and run commands as SYSTEM. This means any user on a domain can escalate to domain admin through PATROL Agent.

      <td>Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values toexceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295will overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds.</td>

An attacker is able to successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device, stop it from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP vulnerabilities, or find sensitive information from the SIP communications. Furthermore, because the SIP communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. For example, passwords can be extracted. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected</td>

The instance part in SASL auth ID is optional and if it's missing, like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM', the authorization check will be skipped. As a result an arbitrary endpoint could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader, essentially giving it complete read-write access to the data tree. Quorum Peer authentication is not enabled by default.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1, 3.8.3, 3.7.2, which fixes the issue.Alternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.See the documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.</td>

This version validates for asymmetric key type and algorithm combinations. Please refer to the above mentioned algorithm / key type combinations for the valid secure configuration. After updating to version 9.0.0, if you still intend to continue with signing or verifying tokens using invalid key type/algorithm value combinations, you’ll need to set the `allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option  to `true` in the `sign()` and/or `verify()` functions.</td>

      <td>Minder is an open source Software Supply Chain Security Platform. Minder's Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First, it sets the `CloneOptions`, specifying the url, the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem, to which it clones and Finally, it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack: A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions: 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones, 2. Minder does not enforce a size limit to the repository, 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>

      <td>Reposilite is an open source, lightweight and easy-to-use repository manager for Maven based artifacts in JVM ecosystem. As a Maven repository manager, Reposilite provides the ability to view the artifacts content in the browser, as well as perform administrative tasks via API. The problem lies in the fact that the artifact's content is served via the same origin (protocol/host/port) as the Admin UI. If the artifact contains HTML content with javascript inside, the javascript is executed within the same origin. Therefore, if an authenticated user is viewing the artifacts content, the javascript inside can access the browser's local storage where the user's password (aka 'token-secret') is stored. It is especially dangerous in scenarios where Reposilite is configured to mirror third party repositories, like the Maven Central Repository. Since anyone can publish an artifact to Maven Central under its own name, such malicious packages can be used to attack the Reposilite instance. This issue may lead to the full Reposilite instance compromise. If this attack is performed against the admin user, it's possible to use the admin API to modify settings and artifacts on the instance. In the worst case scenario, an attacker would be able to obtain the Remote code execution on all systems that use artifacts from Reposilite. It's important to note that the attacker does not need to lure a victim user to use a malicious artifact, but just open a link in the browser. This link can be silently loaded among the other HTML content, making this attack unnoticeable. Even if the Reposilite instance is located in an isolated environment, such as behind a VPN or in the local network, this attack is still possible as it can be performed from the admin browser. Reposilite has addressed this issue in version 3.5.12. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is also tracked as GHSL-2024-072.</td>

NFSD has never sanity-checked the READDIR count argument, but the old entry encodersmanaged the problem correctly.With the commits below, entry encoding changed, exposing theunderflow to the pointer arithmetic in xdr_reserve_space().Modern NFS clients attempt to retrieve as much data as possiblefor each READDIR request. Also, we have no unit tests thatexercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of @countvalues. Thus this case was missed during testing.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:nfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNERThe test on so_count in nfsd4_release_lockowner() is nonsense andharmful.  Revert to using check_for_locks(), changing that to not sleep.First: harmful.As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), thetest on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in areturn of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held.  This isclearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can causeincorrect behaviour.If RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is stillprocessing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that requestwas received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsdthread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) tothe lock owner that causes nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return anincorrect error.The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because itnever sends NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, soit knows that the error is impossible.  It assumes the lock owner was infact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier insome later locking request.When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASEfailed, it will naturally use a lock_seqid of zero.  However the server,which didn't release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid andso will respond with NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID.So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testingso_count allows.The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn't mean anything.so_count is the sum of three different counts.1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks.When it is tested against '2' it is clear that one of these is thetransient reference obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked().  It is notclear what the other one is expected to be.In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one stateon so_stateids.  If there were more, this would fail.In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called.In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE_LOCKOWNER.  That results inall the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded(it is removed when there are no more references which usually happenswhen the lock state is discarded).  When nfsd4_release_lockowner() findsthat the lock owner doesn't exist, it returns success.The other case shows an so_count of '2' and precisely one state listedin so_stateid.  It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lockowner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so thistest on '2' is safe.  For another client it might not be safe.So this patch changes check_for_locks() to use the (newish)find_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a reference on thenfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so never sleeps.  Withthis check is it safe to restore the use of check_for_locks() ratherthan testing so_count against the mysterious '2'.</td>

Per PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.7.1.8:  If a power controller detects a main power fault on the hot-plug slot,  it must automatically set its internal main power fault latch [...].  The main power fault latch is cleared when software turns off power to  the hot-plug slot.The stickiness used to cause interrupt storms and infinite loops whichwere fixed in 2009 by commits 5651c48cfafe ("PCI pciehp: fix power faultinterrupt storm problem") and 99f0169c17f3 ("PCI: pciehp: enablesoftware notification on empty slots").Unfortunately in 2020 the infinite loop issue was inadvertentlyreintroduced by commit 8edf5332c393 ("PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interruptrace"):  The hardirq handler pciehp_isr() clears the PFD bit untilpciehp's power_fault_detected flag is set.  That happens in the IRQthread pciehp_ist(), which never learns of the event because the hardirqhandler is stuck in an infinite loop.

A possible attack scenario could be: 1. a malicious actor register with the targeted user's email (it is unverified), 2. at some later point in time the targeted user stumble on your app and decides to sign-up with OAuth2 (_this step could be also initiated by the attacker by sending an invite email to the targeted user_), 3. on successful OAuth2 auth we search for an existing PocketBase user matching with the OAuth2 user's email and associate them, 4. because we haven't changed the password of the existing PocketBase user during the linking, the malicious actor has access to the targeted user account and will be able to login with the initially created email/password. To prevent this for happening we now reset the password for this specific case if the previously created user wasn't verified (an exception to this is if the linking is explicit/manual, aka. when you send `Authorization:TOKEN` with the OAuth2 auth call). Additionally to warn existing users we now send an email alert in case the user has logged in with password but has at least one OAuth2 account linked. The flow will be further improved with ongoing refactoring and we will start sending emails for "unrecognized device" logins (OTP and MFA is already implemented and will be available with the next v0.23.0 release in the near future).

In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.</td>

      <td>The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).</td>

This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support theSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly byend user applications.The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filterBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head ofthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMSrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the functionreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chainis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retainsinternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes onto call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will mostlikely result in a crash.This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() whichmay cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() onthe BIO.

      <td>Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

      <td>OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version.

      <td>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `SitemapLoader` class of the `langchain-community` package, affecting all versions. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent infinite recursion when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability of services relying on this functionality.</td>

This means the underlyingdoubly-linked list is temporarily inconsistent, page-&gt;prev-&gt;next orpage-&gt;next-&gt;prev might not be equal back to page for some page in thering buffer.The resize operation in ring_buffer_resize() can be invoked in parallel.It calls rb_check_pages() which can detect the described inconsistencyand stop further tracing:[  190.271762] ------------[ cut here ]------------[  190.271771] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6186 at kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:1467 rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0[  190.271789] Modules linked in: [...][  190.271991] Unloaded tainted modules: intel_uncore_frequency(E):1 skx_edac(E):1[  190.272002] CPU: 1 PID: 6186 Comm: cmd.sh Kdump: loaded Tainted: G            E      6.9.0-rc6-default #5 158d3e1e6d0b091c34c3b96bfd99a1c58306d79f[  190.272011] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552c-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014[  190.272015] RIP: 0010:rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0[  190.272023] Code: [...][  190.272028] RSP: 0018:ffff9c37463abb70 EFLAGS: 00010206[  190.272034] RAX: ffff8eba04b6cb80 RBX: 0000000000000007 RCX: ffff8eba01f13d80[  190.272038] RDX: ffff8eba01f130c0 RSI: ffff8eba04b6cd00 RDI: ffff8eba0004c700[  190.272042] RBP: ffff8eba0004c700 R08: 0000000000010002 R09: 0000000000000000[  190.272045] R10: 00000000ffff7f52 R11: ffff8eba7f600000 R12: ffff8eba0004c720[  190.272049] R13: ffff8eba00223a00 R14: 0000000000000008 R15: ffff8eba067a8000[  190.272053] FS:  00007f1bd64752c0(0000) GS:ffff8eba7f680000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000[  190.272057] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[  190.272061] CR2: 00007f1bd6662590 CR3: 000000010291e001 CR4: 0000000000370ef0[  190.272070] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000[  190.272073] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400[  190.272077] Call Trace:[  190.272098]  &lt;TASK&gt;[  190.272189]  ring_buffer_resize+0x2ab/0x460[  190.272199]  __tracing_resize_ring_buffer.part.0+0x23/0xa0[  190.272206]  tracing_resize_ring_buffer+0x65/0x90[  190.272216]  tracing_entries_write+0x74/0xc0[  190.272225]  vfs_write+0xf5/0x420[  190.272248]  ksys_write+0x67/0xe0[  190.272256]  do_syscall_64+0x82/0x170[  190.272363]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e[  190.272373] RIP: 0033:0x7f1bd657d263[  190.272381] Code: [...][  190.272385] RSP: 002b:00007ffe72b643f8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001[  190.272391] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 00007f1bd657d263[  190.272395] RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000555a6eb538e0 RDI: 0000000000000001[  190.272398] RBP: 0000555a6eb538e0 R08: 000000000000000a R09: 0000000000000000[  190.272401] R10: 0000555a6eb55190 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007f1bd6662500[  190.272404] R13: 0000000000000002 R14: 00007f1bd6667c00 R15: 0000000000000002[  190.272412]  &lt;/TASK&gt;[  190.272414] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---Note that ring_buffer_resize() calls rb_check_pages() only if the parenttrace_buffer has recording disabled.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtainedfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixingCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also triggeran overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it isunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtainedfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() andEVP_PKEY_param_check().Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applicationswhen using the "-check" option.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.</td>

Samba, when acting as an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP. In AD, the default permissions on the DNS partition allow creation of new records by authenticated users. This is used for example to allow machines to self-register in DNS. If a DNS record was created that case-insensitively matched the name of the zone, the ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare() routines could be confused into reading memory prior to the list of DNS entries when responding to DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() and so following invalid memory as a pointer.</td>

      <td>SSH</td>
      <td>In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.</td>

Itcompiles, that's all I know.  I'll appreciate some review and testing fromacrn folks.Patch #2+#3 improve follow_pte(), passing a VMA instead of the MM, addingmore sanity checks, and improving the documentation.  Gave it a quick teston x86-64 using VM_PAT that ends up using follow_pte().This patch (of 3):We currently miss handling various cases, resulting in a dangerousfollow_pte() (previously follow_pfn()) usage.(1) We're not checking PTE write permissions.Maybe we should simply always require pte_write() like we do forpin_user_pages_fast(FOLL_WRITE)? Hard to tell, so let's check forACRN_MEM_ACCESS_WRITE for now.(2) We're not rejecting refcounted pages.As we are not using MMU notifiers, messing with refcounted pages isdangerous and can result in use-after-free. Let's make sure to reject them.(3) We are only looking at the first PTE of a bigger range.We only lookup a single PTE, but memmap-&gt;len may span a larger area.Let's loop over all involved PTEs and make sure the PFN range isactually contiguous. Reject everything else: it couldn't have workedeither way, and rather made use access PFNs we shouldn't be accessing.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Forcibly leave nested virt when SMM state is toggledForcibly leave nested virtualization operation if userspace toggles SMMstate via KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS or KVM_SYNC_X86_EVENTS.  If userspaceforces the vCPU out of SMM while it's post-VMXON and then injects an SMI,vmx_enter_smm() will overwrite vmx-&gt;nested.smm.vmxon and end up with bothvmxon=false and smm.vmxon=false, but all other nVMX state allocated.Don't attempt to gracefully handle the transition as (a) most transitionsare nonsencial, e.g. forcing SMM while L2 is running, (b) there isn'tsufficient information to handle all transitions, e.g. SVM wants accessto the SMRAM save state, and (c) KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS must precedeKVM_SET_NESTED_STATE during state restore as the latter disallows puttingthe vCPU into L2 if SMM is active, and disallows tagging the vCPU asbeing post-VMXON in SMM if SMM is not active.Abuse of KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS manifests as a WARN and memory leak in nVMXdue to failure to free vmcs01's shadow VMCS, but the bug goes far beyondjust a memory leak, e.g. toggling SMM on while L2 is active puts the vCPUin an architecturally impossible state.

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:efi: runtime: avoid EFIv2 runtime services on Apple x86 machinesAditya reports [0] that his recent MacbookPro crashes in the firmwarewhen using the variable services at runtime. The culprit appears to be acall to QueryVariableInfo(), which we did not use to call on Apple x86machines in the past as they only upgraded from EFI v1.10 to EFI v2.40firmware fairly recently, and QueryVariableInfo() (along withUpdateCapsule() et al) was added in EFI v2.00.The only runtime service introduced in EFI v2.00 that we actually use inLinux is QueryVariableInfo(), as the capsule based ones are optional,generally not used at runtime (all the LVFS/fwupd firmware updateinfrastructure uses helper EFI programs that invoke capsule update atboot time, not runtime), and not implemented by Apple machines in thefirst place. QueryVariableInfo() is used to 'safely' set variables,i.e., only when there is enough space. This prevents machines with buggyfirmwares from corrupting their NVRAMs when they run out of space.Given that Apple machines have been using EFI v1.10 services only forthe longest time (the EFI v2.0 spec was released in 2006, and Linuxsupport for the newly introduced runtime services was added in 2011, butthe MacbookPro12,1 released in 2015 still claims to be EFI v1.10 only),let's avoid the EFI v2.0 ones on all Apple x86 machines.[0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/6D757C75-65B1-468B-842D-10410081A8E4@live.com/</td>
