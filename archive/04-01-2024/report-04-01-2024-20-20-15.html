      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>Airflow</td>
      <td>Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PMThe kernel allocates a memory buffer and provides its location to thehardware, which uses it to update the HFI table. This allocation occursduring boot and remains constant throughout runtime.When resuming from hibernation, the restore kernel allocates a secondmemory buffer and reprograms the HFI hardware with the new location aspart of a normal boot. The location of the second memory buffer maydiffer from the one allocated by the image kernel.When the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFIbuffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if thehardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from therestore kernel).It is also possible that the hardware "forgets" the address of the memorybuffer when resuming from "deep" suspend. Memory corruption may also occurin such a scenario.To prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing tosuspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.Add syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages ofnon-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on theboot CPU. Additionally, HFI only needs to be disabled during "deep" suspendand hibernation. Syscore ops only run in these cases.[ rjw: Comment adjustment, subject and changelog edits ]</td>

In affected versions a prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.0. Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available.

The loadRepoIndex() function in the ArgoCD's helm package, does not limit the size nor time while fetching the data. It fetches it and creates a byte slice from the retrieved data in one go. If the registry is implemented to push data continuously, the repo server will keep allocating memory until it runs out of it.

Those drivers declared iio events for notifyinguser space when ADC readings fall bellow the thresholds of low limitregisters or above the values set in high limit registers.However, to configure iio events and their thresholds, a set of callbackfunctions must be implemented and those were not present until now.The consequence of trying to configure ad7091r-5 events without theproper callback functions was a null pointer dereference in the kernelbecause the pointers to the callback functions were not set.Implement event configuration callbacks allowing users to read/writeevent thresholds and enable/disable event generation.Since the event spec structs are generic to AD7091R devices, also movethose from the ad7091r-5 driver the base driver so they can be reusedwhen support for ad7091r-2/-4/-8 be added.</td>

A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in memory.</td>

      <td>A vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations.</td>
