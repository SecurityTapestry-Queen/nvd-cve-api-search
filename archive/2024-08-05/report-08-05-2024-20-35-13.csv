CVE-2018-11567,1.4,Amazon,"Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill. The reprompt feature is designed so that if Alexa does not receive an input within 8 seconds, the device can speak a reprompt, then wait an additional 8 seconds for input; if the user still does not respond, the microphone is then turned off. The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard (""gibberish"") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range.

It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct; it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network.

NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing.

CVE-2023-26031,5.9,Hadoop,"Relative library resolution in linux container-executor binary in Apache Hadoop 3.3.1-3.3.4 on Linux allows local user to gain root privileges. If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, this MAY permit remote users to gain root privileges.Hadoop 3.3.0 updated the "" YARN Secure Containers https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/SecureContainer.html "" to add a feature for executing user-submitted applications in isolated linux containers.The native binary HADOOP_HOME/bin/container-executor is used to launch these containers; it must be owned by root and have the suid bit set in order for the YARN processes to run the containers as the specific users submitting the jobs.The patch "" YARN-10495 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10495 . make the rpath of container-executor configurable"" modified the library loading path for loading .so files from ""$ORIGIN/"" to """"$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/"". This is the a path through which libcrypto.so is located. Thus it is is possible for a user with reduced privileges to install a malicious libcrypto library into a path to which they have write access, invoke the container-executor command, and have their modified library executed as root.If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, and these users' submitted job are executed in the physical host, rather than a container, then the CVE permits remote users to gain root privileges.The fix for the vulnerability is to revert the change, which is done in  YARN-11441 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-11441 , ""Revert YARN-10495"".

We've lost the comment at some point (I think whenthe 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:	Assume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy	of eflags from PUSHF.which explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off thestack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just checkif they might be eflags or the return pc:	Eflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addressesbut that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lockdebugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stackframe.It causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] andothers [2].With no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.Just for historical interest, here's some background commits relating tothis code from 2006:  0cb91a229364 (""i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels"")  31679f38d886 (""Simplify profile_pc on x86-64"")and a code unification from 2009:  ef4512882dbe (""x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc"")but the basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git tree.",2024-07-30T13:33:30.653,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-42096

Also, do the same fix ininet_diag_dump_compat() to avoid the similar issue in the future.[1]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in raw_lookup net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:49 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in raw_sock_get+0x657/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_lookup net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:49 [inline] raw_sock_get+0x657/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_diag_dump_one+0xa1/0x660 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:99 inet_diag_cmd_exact+0x7d9/0x980 inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1404 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x469/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282 netlink_rcv_skb+0x537/0x670 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2564 sock_diag_rcv+0x35/0x40 net/core/sock_diag.c:297 netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1335 [inline] netlink_unicast+0xe74/0x1240 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1361 netlink_sendmsg+0x10c6/0x1260 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1905 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0x332/0x3d0 net/socket.c:745 ____sys_sendmsg+0x7f0/0xb70 net/socket.c:2585 ___sys_sendmsg+0x271/0x3b0 net/socket.c:2639 __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2668 [inline] __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2677 [inline] __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2675 [inline] __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x27e/0x4a0 net/socket.c:2675 x64_sys_call+0x135e/0x3ce0 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:47 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xd9/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7fUninit was stored to memory at: raw_sock_get+0x650/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_diag_dump_one+0xa1/0x660 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:99 inet_diag_cmd_exact+0x7d9/0x980 inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1404 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x469/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282 netlink_rcv_skb+0x537/0x670 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2564 sock_diag_rcv+0x35/0x40 net/core/sock_diag.c:297 netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1335 [inline] netlink_unicast+0xe74/0x1240 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1361 netlink_sendmsg+0x10c6/0x1260 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1905 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0x332/0x3d0 net/socket.c:745 ____sys_sendmsg+0x7f0/0xb70 net/socket.c:2585 ___sys_sendmsg+0x271/0x3b0 net/socket.c:2639 __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2668 [inline] __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2677 [inline] __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2675 [inline] __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x27e/0x4a0 net/socket.c:2675 x64_sys_call+0x135e/0x3ce0 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:47 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xd9/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7fLocal variable req.i created at: inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1396 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x2a6/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282CPU: 1 PID: 8888 Comm: syz-executor.6 Not tainted 6.10.0-rc4-00217-g35bb670d65fc #32Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-2.fc40 04/01/2014",2024-07-30T13:32:45.943,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-42106
