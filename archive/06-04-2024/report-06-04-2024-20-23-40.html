      <td>The 'deploy-website.yml' workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically in the 'main' branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to improper authorization. The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN, AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.</td>

      <td>A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the latest version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing attackers to bypass the official fix intended to restrict access to intranet IP addresses and protocols. Despite efforts to filter out intranet IP addresses starting with 192, 172, 10, and 127 through regular expressions and limit access protocols to HTTP and HTTPS, attackers can still bypass these restrictions using alternative representations of IP addresses and accessing other ports running on localhost. This vulnerability enables attackers to access any asset on the internal network, attack web services on the internal network, scan hosts on the internal network, and potentially access AWS metadata endpoints. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, which can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xdp: use flags field to disambiguate broadcast redirectWhen redirecting a packet using XDP, the bpf_redirect_map() helper will setup the redirect destination information in struct bpf_redirect_info (usingthe __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() helper function), and the xdp_do_redirect()function will read this information after the XDP program returns and passthe frame on to the right redirect destination.When using the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag to do multicast redirect to a wholemap, __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() sets the 'map' pointer in structbpf_redirect_info to point to the destination map to be broadcast. Andxdp_do_redirect() reacts to the value of this map pointer to decide whetherit's dealing with a broadcast or a single-value redirect. However, if thedestination map is being destroyed before xdp_do_redirect() is called, themap pointer will be cleared out (by bpf_clear_redirect_map()) withoutwaiting for any XDP programs to stop running. This causes xdp_do_redirect()to think that the redirect was to a single target, but the target pointeris also NULL (since broadcast redirects don't have a single target), sothis causes a crash when a NULL pointer is passed to dev_map_enqueue().To fix this, change xdp_do_redirect() to react directly to the presence ofthe BPF_F_BROADCAST flag in the 'flags' value in struct bpf_redirect_infoto disambiguate between a single-target and a broadcast redirect. And onlyread the 'map' pointer if the broadcast flag is set, aborting if that hasbeen cleared out in the meantime. This prevents the crash, while keepingthe atomic (cmpxchg-based) clearing of the map pointer itself, and withoutadding any more checks in the non-broadcast fast path.</td>

The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.5 and 6.1.2. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected. Users are advised to upgrade.

NOTE: the vendor disputes the severity and claimed vulnerability type of this issue, stating "This PoC crashes VLC, indeed, but does nothing more... this is not an integer overflow error, but an uncaught exception and I doubt that it is exploitable. This uncaught exception makes VLC abort, not execute random code, on my Linux 64bits machine."

      <td>Rubygems.org is the Ruby community's gem hosting service. A Gem publisher can cause a Remote DoS when publishing a Gem. This is due to how Ruby reads the Manifest of Gem files when using Gem::Specification.from_yaml. from_yaml makes use of SafeYAML.load which allows YAML aliases inside the YAML-based metadata of a gem. YAML aliases allow for Denial of Service attacks with so-called `YAML-bombs` (comparable to Billion laughs attacks). This was patched. There is is no action required by users. This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2024-001 and was discovered by the GitHub security lab.</td>

      <td>A code injection vulnerability exists in the huggingface/text-generation-inference repository, specifically within the `autodocs.yml` workflow file. The vulnerability arises from the insecure handling of the `github.head_ref` user input, which is used to dynamically construct a command for installing a software package. An attacker can exploit this by forking the repository, creating a branch with a malicious payload as the name, and then opening a pull request to the base repository. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the GitHub Actions runner. This issue affects versions up to and including v2.0.0 and was fixed in version 2.0.0.</td>

The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, allowing for unauthorized modification of the base repository or secrets exfiltration. The issue affects versions up to and including '@gradio/video@0.6.12'. The flaw is present in the workflow's handling of GitHub context information, where it echoes the full name of the head repository, the head branch, and the workflow reference without adequate sanitization. This could potentially lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as 'GITHUB_TOKEN', 'COMMENT_TOKEN', and 'CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN'.</td>

The webshell will be written to a .jsp file.The mitigation is to restrict (by default) the actions authorized on Jolokia, or disable Jolokia.A more restrictive Jolokia configuration has been defined in default ActiveMQ distribution. We encourage users to upgrade to ActiveMQ distributions version including updated Jolokia configuration: 5.16.6, 5.17.4, 5.18.0, 6.0.0.</td>

      <td>Aircompressor is a library with ports of the Snappy, LZO, LZ4, and Zstandard compression algorithms to Java. All decompressor implementations of Aircompressor (LZ4, LZO, Snappy, Zstandard) can crash the JVM for certain input, and in some cases also leak the content of other memory of the Java process (which could contain sensitive information). When decompressing certain data, the decompressors try to access memory outside the bounds of the given byte arrays or byte buffers. Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed. When decompressing data from untrusted users, this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM, or to leak other sensitive information from the Java process. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</td>

An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Outlook software.

The file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Word software.Two possible email attack scenarios exist for this vulnerability:With the first email attack scenario, an attacker could send a specially crafted email message to the user and wait for the user to click on the message. When the message renders via Microsoft Word in the Outlook Preview Pane, an attack could be triggered.With the second scenario, an attacker could attach a specially crafted file to an email, send it to a user, and convince them to open it.In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or other message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Word handles files in memory.For users who view their emails in Outlook, the Preview Pane attack vector can be mitigated by disabling this feature. The following registry keys can be set to disable the Preview Pane in Outlook on Windows, either via manual editing of the registry or by modifying Group Policy.Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &amp;quot;Changing Keys and Values&amp;quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &amp;quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Edit Registry Data&amp;quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.Outlook 2010:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\OptionsDWORD: DisableReadingPaneValue: 1Outlook 2013:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Outlook\OptionsDWORD: DisableReadingPaneValue: 1Outlook 2016, Outlook 2019, and Office 365 ProPlus:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\OptionsDWORD: DisableReadingPaneValue: 1</td>

However, HDRINCL can cause arace condition. If calling setsockopt(2) with IP_HDRINCL changes HDRINCLwhile __ip_make_skb() is running, the function will access icmphdr in theskb even if it is not included. This causes the issue reported by KMSAN.Check FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH on fl4-&gt;flowi4_flags instead of testing HDRINCLon the socket.Also, fl4-&gt;fl4_icmp_type and fl4-&gt;fl4_icmp_code are not initialized.

This request data can contain sensitive information, including the deprecated Slack verification token. With this verification token, it is possible under specific configurations, an attacker can forge requests and act as the Slack integration. The request body is leaked in log entries matching `event == "slack.*" &amp;&amp; name == "sentry.integrations.slack" &amp;&amp; request_data == *`. The deprecated slack verification token, will be found in the `request_data.token` key. **SaaS users** do not need to take any action. **Self-hosted users** should upgrade to version 24.5.0 or higher, rotate their Slack verification token, and use the Slack Signing Secret instead of the verification token. For users only using the `slack.signing-secret` in their self-hosted configuration, the legacy verification token is not used to verify the webhook payload. It is ignored. Users unable to upgrade should either set the `slack.signing-secret` instead of `slack.verification-token`. The signing secret is Slack's recommended way of authenticating webhooks. By having `slack.singing-secret` set, Sentry self-hosted will no longer use the verification token for authentication of the webhooks, regardless of whether `slack.verification-token` is set or not. Alternatively if the self-hosted instance is unable to be upgraded or re-configured to use the `slack.signing-secret`, the logging configuration can be adjusted to not generate logs from the integration. The default logging configuration can be found in `src/sentry/conf/server.py`. **Services should be restarted once the configuration change is saved.**</td>

Furthermore, because the SMAdata2+ communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected</td>

      <td>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</td>

Note: It has been argued that "The vulnerability reported in PDF Embedder Plugin is not valid as the plugin itself doesn't control or manage the file upload process. It only serves the uploaded PDF files and the responsibility of uploading PDF file remains with the Site owner of Wordpress installation, the upload of PDF file is managed by Wordpress core and not by PDF Embedder Plugin. Control &amp; block of polyglot file is required to be taken care at the time of upload, not on showing the file. Moreover, the reference mentions retrieving the files from the browser cache and manually renaming it to jar for executing the file. That refers to a two step non-connected steps which has nothing to do with PDF Embedder.</td>
