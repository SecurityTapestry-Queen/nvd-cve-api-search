The attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed port has weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented by this vulnerability.

Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.7 (Integrity impacts).

This is problematic because two log lines will often have the same length, so due to these collisions we are reusing the same nonce many times. All audit logs generated by versions of Dgraph &lt;v23.0.0 are affected. Attackers must have access to the system the logs are stored on. Dgraph users should upgrade to v23.0.0. Users unable to upgrade should store existing audit logs in a secure location and for extra security, encrypt using an external tool like `gpg`.</td>

      <td>A vulnerability in the application-hosting subsystem of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device. The attacker could execute IOS XE commands outside the application-hosting subsystem Docker container as well as on the underlying Linux operating system. These commands could be run as the root user. The vulnerability is due to a combination of two factors: (a) incomplete input validation of the user payload of CLI commands, and (b) improper role-based access control (RBAC) when commands are issued at the command line within the application-hosting subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a CLI command with crafted user input. A successful exploit could allow the lower-privileged attacker to execute arbitrary CLI commands with root privileges. The attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.</td>

This impacts all Home Assistant installation types that use the Supervisor 2023.01.1 or older. Installation types, like Home Assistant Container (for example Docker), or Home Assistant Core manually in a Python environment, are not affected. The issue has been mitigated and closed in Supervisor version 2023.03.1, which has been rolled out to all affected installations via the auto-update feature of the Supervisor. This rollout has been completed at the time of publication of this advisory. Home Assistant Core 2023.3.0 included mitigation for this vulnerability. Upgrading to at least that version is thus advised. In case one is not able to upgrade the Home Assistant Supervisor or the Home Assistant Core application at this time, it is advised to not expose your Home Assistant instance to the internet.</td>

Versions prior to 4.38.2 contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability where an Ombi administrative user may access files available to the Ombi server process on the host operating system. Ombi administrators may not always be local system administrators and so this may violate the security expectations of the system. The arbitrary file read vulnerability was present in `ReadLogFile` and `Download` endpoints in `SystemControllers.cs` as the parameter `logFileName` is not sanitized before being combined with the `Logs` directory. When using `Path.Combine(arg1, arg2, arg3)`, an attacker may be able to escape to folders/files outside of `Path.Combine(arg1, arg2)` by using ".." in `arg3`. In addition, by specifying an absolute path for `arg3`, `Path.Combine` will completely ignore the first two arguments and just return just `arg3`. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure. The Ombi `documentation` suggests running Ombi as a Service with Administrator privileges. An attacker targeting such an application may be able to read the files of any Windows user on the host machine and certain system files. This issue has been addressed in commit `b8a8f029` and in release version 4.38.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

      <td>The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set bypass for HTTP multipart requests by submitting a payload that uses a character encoding scheme via the Content-Type or the deprecated Content-Transfer-Encoding multipart MIME header fields that will not be decoded and inspected by the web application firewall engine and the rule set. The multipart payload will therefore bypass detection. A vulnerable backend that supports these encoding schemes can potentially be exploited. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively. The mitigation against these vulnerabilities depends on the installation of the latest ModSecurity version (v2.9.6 / v3.0.8).</td>

      <td>Nextcloud</td>
      <td>Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on LibreOffice technology. This vulnerability report describes a reflected XSS vulnerability with full CSP bypass in Nextcloud installations using the recommended bundle. The vulnerability can be exploited to perform a trivial account takeover attack. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code into web pages, which can be executed in the context of the victim's browser session. This means that an attacker can steal sensitive data, such as login credentials or personal information, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying or deleting data. In this specific case, the vulnerability allows for a trivial account takeover attack. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to inject code into the victim's browser session, allowing the attacker to take over the victim's account without their knowledge or consent. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and data, as well as the ability to perform actions on behalf of the victim. Furthermore, the fact that the vulnerability bypasses the Content Security Policy (CSP) makes it more dangerous, as CSP is an important security mechanism used to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. By bypassing CSP, attackers can circumvent the security measures put in place by the web application and execute their malicious code. This issue has been patched in versions 22.05.13, 21.11.9, and 6.4.27. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>

An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.</td>

Logic was introduced to keep track of how many threads require SSBD active in order to coordinate it, such logic relies on using a per-core counter of threads that have SSBD active. When running on the mentioned hardware, it's possible for a guest to under or overflow the thread counter, because each write to VIRT_SPEC_CTRL.SSBD by the guest gets propagated to the helper that does the per-core active accounting.
