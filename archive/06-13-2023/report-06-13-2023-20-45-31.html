      <td>Pydio Cells through 4.1.2 allows XSS. Pydio Cells implements the download of files using presigned URLs which are generated using the Amazon AWS SDK for JavaScript [1]. The secrets used to sign these URLs are hardcoded and exposed through the JavaScript files of the web application. Therefore, it is possible to generate valid signatures for arbitrary download URLs. By uploading an HTML file and modifying the download URL to serve the file inline instead of as an attachment, any included JavaScript code is executed when the URL is opened in a browser, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.</td>

      <td>UmbracoIdentityExtensions is an Umbraco add-on package that enables easy extensibility points for ASP.Net Identity integration. In affected versions client secrets are not required which may expose some endpoints to untrusted actors. Since Umbraco is not a single-page application, the implicit flow is not safe. For traditional MVC applications, it is recommended to use the authorization code flow, which requires the client to authenticate with the authorization server using a client secret. This flow provides better security, as it involves exchanging an authorization code for an access token and/or ID token, rather than directly returning tokens in the URL fragment. This issue has been patched in commit `e792429f9` and a release to Nuget is pending. Users are advised to upgrade when possible.</td>

      <td>Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers ordata containing them may be very slow.Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any ofthe OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no messagesize limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing thosemessages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translatean ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSLtype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are thesub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated byperiods.When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundredsof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very longtime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of thesub-identifiers in bytes (*).With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECTIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetchingalgorithms.Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structureAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specifywhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt ordecrypt, or digest passed data.Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data areaffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purposeof display, the severity is considered low.In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this onlyimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled clientauthentication.In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a waythat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considerednot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,and the severity is therefore considered low.</td>

      <td>mailcow is a mail server suite based on Dovecot, Postfix and other open source software, that provides a modern web UI for user/server administration. A vulnerability has been discovered in mailcow which allows an attacker to manipulate internal Dovecot variables by using specially crafted passwords during the authentication process. The issue arises from the behavior of the `passwd-verify.lua` script, which is responsible for verifying user passwords during login attempts. Upon a successful login, the script returns a response in the format of "password=&lt;valid-password&gt;", indicating the successful authentication. By crafting a password with additional key-value pairs appended to it, an attacker can manipulate the returned string and influence the internal behavior of Dovecot. For example, using the password "123 mail_crypt_save_version=0" would cause the `passwd-verify.lua` script to return the string "password=123 mail_crypt_save_version=0". Consequently, Dovecot will interpret this string and set the internal variables accordingly, leading to unintended consequences. This vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated attacker who has the ability to set their own password. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in unauthorized access to user accounts, bypassing security controls, or other malicious activities. This issue has been patched in version `2023-05a`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>

      <td>Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path switch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data() calls ip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send() calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU, copy = maxfraglen - skb-&gt;len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computation of fraggap = skb_prev-&gt;len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds. A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in e89e9cf539a2 ("[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach") on Oct 18 2005.</td>

The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution.

      <td>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. In versions of Kyverno prior to 1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field defined can bypass validate, generate, or mutate-existing policies, even in cases where the `validationFailureAction` field is set to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources pending deletion were being consciously exempted by Kyverno, as a way to reduce processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects which are being deleted. However, this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user to leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes API server to set the `deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the delete operation as a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this is not applicable to Kubernetes Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes Service resource can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass policies. This is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known workaround.</td>

However the implementation of the function does notenable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrectpolicies to pass the certificate verification.As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it wasdecided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()function.Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificatepolicy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitlyenable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() withthe X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are notcommonly used by applications.</td>

This information could then be used to obtain ASLR offsets for a process with an existing memory corruption vulnerability.

The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user’s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution.

IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks.
