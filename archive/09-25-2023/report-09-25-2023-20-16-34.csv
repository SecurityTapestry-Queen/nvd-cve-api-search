CVE-2023-42443,5.9,Ethereum,"Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In version 0.3.9 and prior, under certain conditions, the memory used by the builtins `raw_call`, `create_from_blueprint` and `create_copy_of` can be corrupted. For `raw_call`, the argument buffer of the call can be corrupted, leading to incorrect `calldata` in the sub-context. For `create_from_blueprint` and `create_copy_of`, the buffer for the to-be-deployed bytecode can be corrupted, leading to deploying incorrect bytecode.Each builtin has conditions that must be fulfilled for the corruption to happen. For `raw_call`, the `data` argument of the builtin must be `msg.data` and the `value` or `gas` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory. For `create_copy_of`, the `value` or `salt` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory. For `create_from_blueprint`, either no constructor parameters should be passed to the builtin or `raw_args` should be set to True, and the `value` or `salt` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory.As of time of publication, no patched version exists. The issue is still being investigated, and there might be other cases where the corruption might happen. When the builtin is being called from an `internal` function `F`, the issue is not present provided that the function calling `F` wrote to memory before calling `F`. As a workaround, the complex expressions that are being passed as kwargs to the builtin should be cached in memory prior to the call to the builtin.",2023-09-22T14:30:04.887,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-42443

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtainedfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixingCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also triggeran overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it isunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtainedfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() andEVP_PKEY_param_check().Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applicationswhen using the ""-check"" option.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.",2023-09-23T00:15:19.610,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-3817
CVE-2023-4807,5.9,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementationcontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on theWindows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64 processors supporting theAVX512-IFMA instructions.Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attackercan influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the applicationstate might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL doesnot save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platformwhen calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning tothe caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring theirprevious content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processorssupporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized sothe attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependentcalculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEADcipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications usingOpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware ofany concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore weconsider this a Low severity security issue.As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled atruntime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap:   OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.",2023-09-21T17:15:24.233,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-4807

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication.

This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer.

It was previously stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was vulnerable, and upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in version 3.1.",2023-09-22T18:25:54.447,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-1000376
CVE-2023-41880,1.4,X86,"Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime versions from 10.0.0 to versions 10.02, 11.0.2, and 12.0.1 contain a miscompilation of the WebAssembly `i64x2.shr_s` instruction on x86_64 platforms when the shift amount is a constant value that is larger than 32. Only x86_64 is affected so all other targets are not affected by this. The miscompilation results in the instruction producing an incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second lane of the vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the input vector instead of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this issue is that any WebAssembly program using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce an incorrect result.This issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox. Execution of WebAssembly guest programs will still behave correctly with respect to memory sandboxing and isolation from the host. Wasmtime considers non-spec-compliant behavior as a security issue nonetheless.This issue was discovered through fuzzing of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.Wasmtime versions 10.0.2, 11.0.2, and 12.0.2 are all patched to no longer have this miscompilation. This issue only affects x86_64 hosts and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm modules which is nontrivial or to disable the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly. Users prior to 10.0.0 are unaffected by this vulnerability.",2023-09-21T16:17:54.780,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-41880
