CVE-2023-44388,3.6,Discourse,Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. A malicious request can cause production log files to quickly fill up and thus result in the server running out of disk space. This problem has been patched in the 3.1.1 stable and 3.2.0.beta2 versions of Discourse. It is possible to temporarily work around this problem by reducing the `client_max_body_size nginx directive`. `client_max_body_size` will limit the size of uploads that can be uploaded directly to the server.,2023-10-17T12:38:17.143,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-44388

CVE-2023-36478,3.6,Eclipse,"Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values toexceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295will overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server.

CVE-2023-45130,3.6,Ethereum,"Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit aea528198b3b226e0d20cce878551fd4c0e3d5d0, at the end of a contract execution, when opcode SUICIDE marks a contract to be deleted, the software uses `storage::remove_prefix` (now renamed to `storage::clear_prefix`) to remove all storages associated with it. This is a single IO primitive call passing the WebAssembly boundary. For large contracts, the call (without providing a `limit` parameter) can be slow. In addition, for parachains, all storages to be deleted will be part of the PoV, which easily exceed relay chain PoV size limit. On the other hand, Frontier's maintainers only charge a fixed cost for opcode SUICIDE. The maintainers consider the severity of this issue high, because an attacker can craft a contract with a lot of storage values on a parachain, and then call opcode SUICIDE on the contract. If the transaction makes into a parachain block, the parachain will then stall because the PoV size will exceed relay chain's limit. This is especially an issue for XCM transactions, because they can't be skipped. Commit aea528198b3b226e0d20cce878551fd4c0e3d5d0 contains a patch for this issue. For parachains, it's recommended to issue an emergency runtime upgrade as soon as possible. For standalone chains, the impact is less severe because the issue mainly affects PoV sizes. It's recommended to issue a normal runtime upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.",2023-10-13T13:46:47.010,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-45130

CVE-2023-44392,6.0,Kubernetes,"Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable.

CVE-2023-43633,6.0,SSH,"On boot, the Pillar eve container checks for the existence and content of“/config/GlobalConfig/global.json”.If the file exists, it overrides the existing configuration on the device on boot.This allows an attacker to change the system’s configuration, which also includes somedebug functions.This could be used to unlock the ssh with custom “authorized_keys” via the“debug.enable.ssh” key, similar to the “authorized_keys” finding that was noted before.Other usages include unlocking the usb to enable the keyboard via the “debug.enable.usb”key, allowing VNC access via the “app.allow.vnc” key, and more.An attacker could easily enable these debug functionalities without triggering the “measuredboot” mechanism implemented by EVE OS, and without marking the device as “UUD”(“Unknown Update Detected”).This is because the “/config” partition is not protected by “measured boot”, it is mutable and itis not encrypted in any way.An attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values, thereby nottriggering the “measured boot” mechanism, and having full access to the vault.Note:This issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure to Zededa), where the configpartition measurement was added to PCR13:• aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141• 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.This issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but it was not included in the measured boot.",2023-10-16T19:30:32.823,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-43633
