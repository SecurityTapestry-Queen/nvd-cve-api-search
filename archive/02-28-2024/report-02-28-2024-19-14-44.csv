CVE-2023-46241,6.0,Discourse,"`discourse-microsoft-auth` is a plugin that enables authentication via Microsoft. On sites with the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin enabled, an attack can potentially take control of a victim's Discourse account. Sites that have configured their application's account type to any options other than `Accounts in this organizational directory only (O365 only - Single tenant)` are vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in commit c40665f44509724b64938c85def9fb2e79f62ec8 of `discourse-microsoft-auth`. A `microsoft_auth:revoke` rake task has also been added which will deactivate and log out all users that have connected their accounts to Microsoft. User API keys as well as API keys created by those users will also be revoked. The rake task will also remove the connection records to Microsoft for those users. This will allow affected users to re-verify their account emails as well as reconnect their Discourse account to Microsoft for authentication. As a workaround, disable the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin by setting the `microsoft_auth_enabled` site setting to `false`. Run the `microsoft_auth:log_out_users` rake task to log out all users with associated Microsoft accounts.",2024-02-22T19:07:27.197,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-46241

CVE-2021-46987,NA,IoT,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroupsThere are a few exceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs tocopy the inline extent data into a page of the destination inode.When this happens, we end up starting a transaction while having a dirtypage for the destination inode and while having the range locked in thedestination's inode iotree too. Because when reserving metadata spacefor a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case there isnot enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to prevent a deadlock,which was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d (""btrfs: fix deadlock whencloning inline extent and low on free metadata space"").However when using qgroups, a transaction also reserves metadata qgroupspace, which can also result in flushing delalloc in case there is notenough available space at the moment. When this happens we deadlock, sinceflushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotreeand the range was already locked at the very beginning of the cloneoperation, before attempting to start the transaction.When this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:  [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9   state:D stack:    0 pid:  225 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000  [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-1142)  [72747.556271] Call Trace:  [72747.556273]  __schedule+0x296/0x760  [72747.556277]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0  [72747.556279]  io_schedule+0x12/0x40  [72747.556284]  __lock_page+0x13c/0x280  [72747.556287]  ? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70  [72747.556325]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs]  [72747.556331]  ? __set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160  [72747.556358]  ? set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs]  [72747.556362]  ? update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210  [72747.556366]  ? cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20  [72747.556391]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]  [72747.556394]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0  [72747.556398]  __writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0  [72747.556403]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440  [72747.556407]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0  [72747.556410]  wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0  [72747.556414]  ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50  [72747.556417]  wb_workfn+0x354/0x490  [72747.556420]  ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0  [72747.556424]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340  [72747.556426]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390  [72747.556429]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0  [72747.556432]  kthread+0x116/0x130  [72747.556435]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80  [72747.556438]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30  [72747.566958] Workqueue: btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]  [72747.566961] Call Trace:  [72747.566964]  __schedule+0x296/0x760  [72747.566968]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80  [72747.566970]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0  [72747.566995]  wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs]  [72747.566999]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80  [72747.567024]  lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs]  [72747.567047]  btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs]  [72747.567051]  ? find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380  [72747.567076]  __extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs]  [72747.567102]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs]  [72747.567106]  ? update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0  [72747.567109]  ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0  [72747.567134]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]  [72747.567137]  ? enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0  [72747.567140]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0  [72747.567144]  __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100  [72747.567167]  btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs]  [72747.567195]  btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs]  [72747.567200]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340  [72747.567202]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390  [72747.567205]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0  [72747.567208]  kthread+0x116/0x130  [72747.567211]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80  [72747.567214]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30  [72747.569686] task:fsstress        state:D stack:    ---truncated---",2024-02-28T14:06:45.783,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-46987

CVE-2024-26147,3.6,Kubernetes,"Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Versions prior to 3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm parses index and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When either an `index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were missing all metadata a panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK, this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile` functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the `plugin` package. For the Helm client this impacts functions around adding a repository and all Helm functions if a malicious plugin is added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each invocation. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin has been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using Helm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use `recover` to catch the panic.",2024-02-22T19:07:27.197,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26147

CVE-2021-46997,NA,Virtual Machine,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64: entry: always set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during entryZenghui reports that booting a kernel with ""irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1""on the command line hits a warning during kernel entry, due to the waywe manipulate the PMR.Early in the entry sequence, we call lockdep_hardirqs_off() to informlockdep that interrupts have been masked (as the HW sets DAIF wqhenentering an exception). Architecturally PMR_EL1 is not affected byexception entry, and we don't set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR early inthe exception entry sequence, so early in exception entry the PMR canindicate that interrupts are unmasked even though they are masked byDAIF.If DEBUG_LOCKDEP is selected, lockdep_hardirqs_off() will check thatinterrupts are masked, before we set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in any of theexception entry paths, and hence lockdep_hardirqs_off() will WARN() thatsomething is amiss.We can avoid this by consistently setting GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET duringexception entry so that kernel code sees a consistent environment. Wemust also update local_daif_inherit() to undo this, as currently onlytouches DAIF. For other paths, local_daif_restore() will update bothDAIF and the PMR. With this done, we can remove the existing specialcases which set this later in the entry code.We always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) for consistency withlocal_daif_save(), as this will warn if it ever encounters(GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), and never sets this itself.

CVE-2021-47011,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm: memcontrol: slab: fix obtain a reference to a freeing memcgPatch series ""Use obj_cgroup APIs to charge kmem pages"", v5.Since Roman's series ""The new cgroup slab memory controller"" applied.All slab objects are charged with the new APIs of obj_cgroup.  The newAPIs introduce a struct obj_cgroup to charge slab objects.  It preventslong-living objects from pinning the original memory cgroup in thememory.  But there are still some corner objects (e.g.  allocationslarger than order-1 page on SLUB) which are not charged with the newAPIs.  Those objects (include the pages which are allocated from buddyallocator directly) are charged as kmem pages which still hold areference to the memory cgroup.E.g.  We know that the kernel stack is charged as kmem pages because thesize of the kernel stack can be greater than 2 pages (e.g.  16KB onx86_64 or arm64).  If we create a thread (suppose the thread stack ischarged to memory cgroup A) and then move it from memory cgroup A tomemory cgroup B.  Because the kernel stack of the thread hold areference to the memory cgroup A.  The thread can pin the memory cgroupA in the memory even if we remove the cgroup A.  If we want to see thisscenario by using the following script.  We can see that the system hasadded 500 dying cgroups (This is not a real world issue, just a scriptto show that the large kmallocs are charged as kmem pages which can pinthe memory cgroup in the memory).	#!/bin/bash	cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory	cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory	echo 1 > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate	for i in range{1..500}	do		mkdir kmem_test		echo $$ > kmem_test/cgroup.procs		sleep 3600 &		echo $$ > cgroup.procs		echo `cat kmem_test/cgroup.procs` > cgroup.procs		rmdir kmem_test	done	cat /proc/cgroups | grep memoryThis patchset aims to make those kmem pages to drop the reference tomemory cgroup by using the APIs of obj_cgroup.  Finally, we can see thatthe number of the dying cgroups will not increase if we run the above testscript.This patch (of 7):The rcu_read_lock/unlock only can guarantee that the memcg will not befreed, but it cannot guarantee the success of css_get (which is in therefill_stock when cached memcg changed) to memcg.  rcu_read_lock()  memcg = obj_cgroup_memcg(old)  __memcg_kmem_uncharge(memcg)      refill_stock(memcg)          if (stock->cached != memcg)              // css_get can change the ref counter from 0 back to 1.              css_get(&memcg->css)  rcu_read_unlock()This fix is very like the commit:  eefbfa7fd678 (""mm: memcg/slab: fix use after free in obj_cgroup_charge"")Fix this by holding a reference to the memcg which is passed to the__memcg_kmem_uncharge() before calling __memcg_kmem_uncharge().",2024-02-28T14:06:45.783,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47011
