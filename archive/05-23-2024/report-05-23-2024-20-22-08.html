These tokens can then be used to push/pull images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy has access.

      <td>Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill. The reprompt feature is designed so that if Alexa does not receive an input within 8 seconds, the device can speak a reprompt, then wait an additional 8 seconds for input; if the user still does not respond, the microphone is then turned off. The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard ("gibberish") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range. NOTE: The vendor states "Customer trust is important to us and we take security and privacy seriously. We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do. Customers do not need to take any action for these mitigations to work.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/psi: Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue()If a non-root cgroup gets removed when there is a thread that registeredtrigger and is polling on a pressure file within the cgroup, the pollingwaitqueue gets freed in the following path: do_rmdir   cgroup_rmdir     kernfs_drain_open_files       cgroup_file_release         cgroup_pressure_release           psi_trigger_destroyHowever, the polling thread still has a reference to the pressure file andwill access the freed waitqueue when the file is closed or upon exit: fput   ep_eventpoll_release     ep_free       ep_remove_wait_queue         remove_wait_queueThis results in use-after-free as pasted below.The fundamental problem here is that cgroup_file_release() (andconsequently waitqueue's lifetime) is not tied to the file's real lifetime.Using wake_up_pollfree() here might be less than ideal, but it is in linewith the comment at commit 42288cb44c4b ("wait: add wake_up_pollfree()")since the waitqueue's lifetime is not tied to file's one and can beconsidered as another special case. While this would be fixable by somehowmaking cgroup_file_release() be tied to the fput(), it would requiresizable refactoring at cgroups or higher layer which might be morejustifiable if we identify more cases like this.

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Mark target gfn of emulated atomic instruction as dirtyWhen emulating an atomic access on behalf of the guest, mark the targetgfn dirty if the CMPXCHG by KVM is attempted and doesn't fault.  Thisfixes a bug where KVM effectively corrupts guest memory during livemigration by writing to guest memory without informing userspace that thepage is dirty.Marking the page dirty got unintentionally dropped when KVM's emulatedCMPXCHG was converted to do a user access.  Before that, KVM explicitlymapped the guest page into kernel memory, and marked the page dirty duringthe unmap phase.Mark the page dirty even if the CMPXCHG fails, as the old data is writtenback on failure, i.e. the page is still written.  The value written isguaranteed to be the same because the operation is atomic, but KVM's ABIis that all writes are dirty logged regardless of the value written.  Andmore importantly, that's what KVM did before the buggy commit.Huge kudos to the folks on the Cc list (and many others), who did all theactual work of triaging and debugging.base-commit: 6769ea8da8a93ed4630f1ce64df6aafcaabfce64</td>

It was found that the PatrolCli application can allow for lateral movement and escalation of privilege inside a Windows Active Directory environment. It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct; it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network. This means if you have PATROL Agent installed on a high value target (domain controller), you can use a low privileged domain user to authenticate with PatrolCli and then connect to the domain controller and run commands as SYSTEM. This means any user on a domain can escalate to domain admin through PATROL Agent.

NOTE: A third-party maintainer has stated that this CVE is a false report. They state that the csrf_callback function is actually a callback function to the callers own handler for output. The function called can be changed via configuration to a custom callback to handle failed validation differently. They also stated that there is no way for an attacker to change tokens to make them valid from the client side.

This attack vector isn't exploitable unless the user has manually loosened ACLs on the system drive. If the user's system locale is not English, then the name of the executable will likely vary. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate. Alternatively, ensure that proper permissions and directory access control are set to deny users the ability to write files to the top-level directory `C:`.

      <td>An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:swiotlb: Fix double-allocation of slots due to broken alignment handlingCommit bbb73a103fbb ("swiotlb: fix a braino in the alignment check fix"),which was a fix for commit 0eee5ae10256 ("swiotlb: fix slot alignmentchecks"), causes a functional regression with vsock in a virtual machineusing bouncing via a restricted DMA SWIOTLB pool.When virtio allocates the virtqueues for the vsock device usingdma_alloc_coherent(), the SWIOTLB search can return page-unalignedallocations if 'area-&gt;index' was left unaligned by a previous allocationfrom the buffer: # Final address in brackets is the SWIOTLB address returned to the caller | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1645-1649/7168 (0x98326800) | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1649-1653/7168 (0x98328800) | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1653-1657/7168 (0x9832a800)This ends badly (typically buffer corruption and/or a hang) becauseswiotlb_alloc() is expecting a page-aligned allocation and so blindlyreturns a pointer to the 'struct page' corresponding to the allocation,therefore double-allocating the first half (2KiB slot) of the 4KiB page.Fix the problem by treating the allocation alignment separately to anyadditional alignment requirements from the device, using the maximumof the two as the stride to search the buffer slots and taking careto ensure a minimum of page-alignment for buffers larger than a page.This also resolves swiotlb allocation failures occuring due to theinclusion of ~PAGE_MASK in 'iotlb_align_mask' for large allocations andresulting in alignment requirements exceeding swiotlb_max_mapping_size().</td>

The privileged helper tool creates new VPN connections by executing the openvpn binary located in the /Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources directory. The openvpn binary can be overwritten by the default user, which allows an attacker that has already installed malicious software as the default user to replace the binary.

      <td>Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be veryslow.Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters mayexperience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checkedhave been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial ofService.The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() performvarious checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long timeif the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow usingpublic keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signatureverification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limitthe modulus size when performing the checks.An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could bevulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys soonly applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applicationswhen using the `-check` option.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.</td>

However, pairing each mmiowb() removal in this patch withthe corresponding call to spin_unlock() is not at all trivial, so thereis a small chance that this change may regress any drivers incorrectlyrelying on mmiowb() to order MMIO writes between CPUs using lock-freesynchronisation."The mmio in radeon_ring_commit() is protected by a mutex rather than aspinlock, but in the mutex fastpath it behaves similar to spinlock. Wecan add mmiowb() calls in the radeon driver but the maintainer says hedoesn't like such a workaround, and radeon is not the only example ofmutex protected mmio.So we should extend the mmiowb tracking system from spinlock to mutex,and maybe other locking primitives. This is not easy and error prone, sowe solve it in the architectural code, by simply defining the __io_aw()hook as mmiowb().

This will loop over themsg until msg_pl is full, checked by sk_msg_full(msg_pl). The usercan also set the MORE flag to hint stack to delay sending until receivingmore pages and ideally a full buffer.If the user adds more pages to the msg than can fit in the msg_plscatterlist (MAX_MSG_FRAGS) we should ignore the MORE flag and sendthe buffer anyways.What actually happens though is we abort the msg to msg_pl scatterlistsetup and then because we forget to set 'full record' indicating wecan no longer consume data without a send we fallthrough to the 'continue'path which will check if msg_data_left(msg) has more bytes to send andthen attempts to fit them in the already full msg_pl. Then nextiteration of sender doing send will encounter a full msg_pl and throwthe warning in the syzbot report.To fix simply check if we have a full_record in splice code path andif not send the msg regardless of MORE flag.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: Fix vector state restore in rt_sigreturn()The RISC-V Vector specification states in "Appendix D: CallingConvention for Vector State" [1] that "Executing a system call causesall caller-saved vector registers (v0-v31, vl, vtype) and vstart tobecome unspecified.". In the RISC-V kernel this is called "discardingthe vstate".Returning from a signal handler via the rt_sigreturn() syscall, vectordiscard is also performed. However, this is not an issue since thevector state should be restored from the sigcontext, and therefore notcare about the vector discard.The "live state" is the actual vector register in the running context,and the "vstate" is the vector state of the task. A dirty live state,means that the vstate and live state are not in synch.When vectorized user_from_copy() was introduced, an bug sneaked in atthe restoration code, related to the discard of the live state.An example when this go wrong:  1. A userland application is executing vector code  2. The application receives a signal, and the signal handler is     entered.  3. The application returns from the signal handler, using the     rt_sigreturn() syscall.  4. The live vector state is discarded upon entering the     rt_sigreturn(), and the live state is marked as "dirty", indicating     that the live state need to be synchronized with the current     vstate.  5. rt_sigreturn() restores the vstate, except the Vector registers,     from the sigcontext  6. rt_sigreturn() restores the Vector registers, from the sigcontext,     and now the vectorized user_from_copy() is used. The dirty live     state from the discard is saved to the vstate, making the vstate     corrupt.  7. rt_sigreturn() returns to the application, which crashes due to     corrupted vstate.Note that the vectorized user_from_copy() is invoked depending on thevalue of CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_V_UCOPY_THRESHOLD. Default is 768, whichmeans that vlen has to be larger than 128b for this bug to trigger.The fix is simply to mark the live state as non-dirty/clean priorperforming the vstate restore.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:virtio_net: Do not send RSS key if it is not supportedThere is a bug when setting the RSS options in virtio_net that can breakthe whole machine, getting the kernel into an infinite loop.Running the following command in any QEMU virtual machine with virtionetwill reproduce this problem:    # ethtool -X eth0  hfunc toeplitzThis is how the problem happens:1) ethtool_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_set_rxfh()2) virtnet_set_rxfh() calls virtnet_commit_rss_command()3) virtnet_commit_rss_command() populates 4 entries for the rssscatter-gather4) Since the command above does not have a key, then the lastscatter-gatter entry will be zeroed, since rss_key_size == 0.sg_buf_size = vi-&gt;rss_key_size;5) This buffer is passed to qemu, but qemu is not happy with a bufferwith zero length, and do the following in virtqueue_map_desc() (QEMUfunction):  if (!sz) {      virtio_error(vdev, "virtio: zero sized buffers are not allowed");6) virtio_error() (also QEMU function) set the device as broken    vdev-&gt;broken = true;7) Qemu bails out, and do not repond this crazy kernel.8) The kernel is waiting for the response to come back (functionvirtnet_send_command())9) The kernel is waiting doing the following :      while (!virtqueue_get_buf(vi-&gt;cvq, &amp;tmp) &amp;&amp;\t     !virtqueue_is_broken(vi-&gt;cvq))\t      cpu_relax();10) None of the following functions above is true, thus, the kernelloops here forever. Keeping in mind that virtqueue_is_broken() doesnot look at the qemu `vdev-&gt;broken`, so, it never realizes that thevitio is broken at QEMU side.Fix it by not sending RSS commands if the feature is not available inthe device.</td>

Note: It has been argued that "The vulnerability reported in PDF Embedder Plugin is not valid as the plugin itself doesn't control or manage the file upload process. It only serves the uploaded PDF files and the responsibility of uploading PDF file remains with the Site owner of Wordpress installation, the upload of PDF file is managed by Wordpress core and not by PDF Embedder Plugin. Control &amp; block of polyglot file is required to be taken care at the time of upload, not on showing the file. Moreover, the reference mentions retrieving the files from the browser cache and manually renaming it to jar for executing the file. That refers to a two step non-connected steps which has nothing to do with PDF Embedder.</td>

But the per CPU cached xfd value is notreset, which brings them out of sync.As a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to updatethe MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernelspace, which crashes the kernel.To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state togetherwith MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.</td>

The latter mapping is not active yet at this point, and sosymbol references that rely on it will fault.Given that the core kernel is built without -fPIC, symbol references aretypically emitted as absolute, and so any such references occuring inthe early startup code will therefore crash the kernel.While an attempt was made to work around this for the early SEV/SMEstartup code, by forcing RIP-relative addressing for certain globalSEV/SME variables via inline assembly (see snp_cpuid_get_table() forexample), RIP-relative addressing must be pervasively enforced forSEV/SME global variables when accessed prior to page table fixups.__startup_64() already handles this issue for select non-SEV/SME globalvariables using fixup_pointer(), which adjusts the pointer relative to a`physaddr` argument. To avoid having to pass around this `physaddr`argument across all functions needing to apply pointer fixups, introducea macro RIP_RELATIVE_REF() which generates a RIP-relative reference toa given global variable. It is used where necessary to forceRIP-relative accesses to global variables.For backporting purposes, this patch makes no attempt at cleaning upother occurrences of this pattern, involving either inline asm orfixup_pointer(). Those will be addressed later.  [ bp: Call it "rip_rel_ref" everywhere like other code shortens    "rIP-relative reference" and make the asm wrapper __always_inline. ]</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/efistub: Call mixed mode boot services on the firmware's stackNormally, the EFI stub calls into the EFI boot services using the stackthat was live when the stub was entered. According to the UEFI spec,this stack needs to be at least 128k in size - this might seem large butall asynchronous processing and event handling in EFI runs from the samestack and so quite a lot of space may be used in practice.In mixed mode, the situation is a bit different: the bootloader callsthe 32-bit EFI stub entry point, which calls the decompressor's 32-bitentry point, where the boot stack is set up, using a fixed allocationof 16k. This stack is still in use when the EFI stub is started in64-bit mode, and so all calls back into the EFI firmware will be usingthe decompressor's limited boot stack.Due to the placement of the boot stack right after the boot heap, anystack overruns have gone unnoticed. However, commit  5c4feadb0011983b ("x86/decompressor: Move global symbol references to C code")moved the definition of the boot heap into C code, and now the bootstack is placed right at the base of BSS, where any overruns willcorrupt the end of the .data section.While it would be possible to work around this by increasing the size ofthe boot stack, doing so would affect all x86 systems, and mixed modesystems are a tiny (and shrinking) fraction of the x86 installed base.So instead, record the firmware stack pointer value when entering fromthe 32-bit firmware, and switch to this stack every time a EFI bootservice call is made.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:usb: dwc2: fix possible NULL pointer dereference caused by driver concurrencyIn _dwc2_hcd_urb_enqueue(), "urb-&gt;hcpriv = NULL" is executed withoutholding the lock "hsotg-&gt;lock". In _dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue():    spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;hsotg-&gt;lock, flags);    ...\tif (!urb-&gt;hcpriv) {\t\tdev_dbg(hsotg-&gt;dev, "## urb-&gt;hcpriv is NULL ##\n");\t\tgoto out;\t}    rc = dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue(hsotg, urb-&gt;hcpriv); // Use urb-&gt;hcpriv    ...out:    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;hsotg-&gt;lock, flags);When _dwc2_hcd_urb_enqueue() and _dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue() areconcurrently executed, the NULL check of "urb-&gt;hcpriv" can be executedbefore "urb-&gt;hcpriv = NULL". After urb-&gt;hcpriv is NULL, it can be usedin the function call to dwc2_hcd_urb_dequeue(), which can cause a NULLpointer dereference.This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tooldeveloped by myself. This tool analyzes the locking APIs to extractfunction pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then analyzes theinstructions in the paired functions to identify possible concurrencybugs including data races and atomicity violations. The above possiblebug is reported, when my tool analyzes the source code of Linux 6.5.To fix this possible bug, "urb-&gt;hcpriv = NULL" should be executed withholding the lock "hsotg-&gt;lock". After using this patch, my tool neverreports the possible bug, with the kernelconfiguration allyesconfig forx86_64. Because I have no associated hardware, I cannot test the patchin runtime testing, and just verify it according to the code logic.</td>
