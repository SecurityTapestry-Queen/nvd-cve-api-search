CVE-2022-4725,5.9,AWS,A vulnerability was found in AWS SDK 2.59.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function XpathUtils of the file aws-android-sdk-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/util/XpathUtils.java of the component XML Parser. The manipulation leads to server-side request forgery. Upgrading to version 2.59.1 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is c3e6d69422e1f0c80fe53f2d757b8df97619af2b. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier VDB-216737 was assigned to this vulnerability.,2024-04-11T01:17:28.870,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-4725

CVE-2024-28056,NA,AWS,"Amazon AWS Amplify CLI before 12.10.1 incorrectly configures the role trust policy of IAM roles associated with Amplify projects. When the Authentication component is removed from an Amplify project, a Condition property is removed but ""Effect"":""Allow"" remains present, and consequently sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity would be available to threat actors with no conditions. Thus, if Amplify CLI had been used to remove the Authentication component from a project built between August 2019 and January 2024, an ""assume role"" may have occurred, and may have been leveraged to obtain unauthorized access to an organization's AWS resources. NOTE: the problem could only occur if an authorized AWS user removed an Authentication component. (The vulnerability did not give a threat actor the ability to remove an Authentication component.) However, in realistic situations, an authorized AWS user may have removed an Authentication component, e.g., if the objective were to stop using built-in Cognito resources, or move to a completely different identity provider.",2024-04-15T19:12:25.887,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-28056

CVE-2018-11567,1.4,Amazon,"Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill. The reprompt feature is designed so that if Alexa does not receive an input within 8 seconds, the device can speak a reprompt, then wait an additional 8 seconds for input; if the user still does not respond, the microphone is then turned off. The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard (""gibberish"") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range.

CVE-2020-11710,5.9,Docker,"An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing.

CVE-2024-26687,NA,Xen,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanupshutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking theirq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Bothare called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.This opens multiple races:- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event  channel:  CPU0                        CPU1  shutdown_pirq {    xen_evtchn_close(e)                              __startup_pirq {                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)                              }    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)    }  }  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel  number.  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.The fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the eventchannel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it'spotential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the eventchannel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMedevices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irqis called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race duringboot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq andstartup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.  ------------[ cut here ]------------  blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush: disabled; persistent grants: enabled; indirect descriptors: enabled; bounce buffer: enabled  kernel BUG at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:499!  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI  CPU: 44 PID: 375 Comm: kworker/u257:23 Not tainted 5.10.201-191.748.amzn2.x86_64 #1  Hardware name: Xen HVM domU, BIOS 4.11.amazon 08/24/2006  Workqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work  RIP: 0010:bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0  Code: 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc 44 89 f7 e8 2b 55 ad ff 49 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 64 ff ff ff 4c 8b 68 30 41 83 fe ff 0f 85 60 ff ff ff <0f> 0b 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 0f 1f 44 00 00  RSP: 0000:ffffc9000d533b08 EFLAGS: 00010046  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000006  RDX: 0000000000000028 RSI: 00000000ffffffff RDI: 00000000ffffffff  RBP: ffff888107419680 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffffff82d72b00  R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 00000000000001ed  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00000000ffffffff R15: 0000000000000002  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88bc8b500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000002610001 CR4: 00000000001706e0  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400  Call Trace:   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? set_affinity_irq+0xdc/0x1c0   ? __die_body.cold+0x8/0xd   ? die+0x2b/0x50   ? do_trap+0x90/0x110   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x12/0x20   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0x---truncated---",2024-04-13T12:15:11.463,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26687
