      <td>Prior to 2018-04-27, the reprompt feature in Amazon Echo devices could be misused by a custom Alexa skill. The reprompt feature is designed so that if Alexa does not receive an input within 8 seconds, the device can speak a reprompt, then wait an additional 8 seconds for input; if the user still does not respond, the microphone is then turned off. The vulnerability involves empty output-speech reprompts, custom wildcard ("gibberish") input slots, and logging of detected speech. If a maliciously designed skill is installed, an attacker could obtain transcripts of speech not intended for Alexa to process, but simply spoken within the device's hearing range. NOTE: The vendor states "Customer trust is important to us and we take security and privacy seriously. We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do. Customers do not need to take any action for these mitigations to work.</td>

Prior to version 2.1.0.28, SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code which has a vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value. There is no vulnerability in the driver when using the default, extended query mode. Note that `preferQueryMode` is not a supported parameter in Redshift JDBC driver, and is inherited code from Postgres JDBC driver. Users who do not override default settings to utilize this unsupported query mode are not affected. This issue is patched in driver version 2.1.0.28. As a workaround, do not use the connection property `preferQueryMode=simple`. (NOTE: Those who do not explicitly specify a query mode use the default of extended query mode and are not affected by this issue.)</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Mark target gfn of emulated atomic instruction as dirtyWhen emulating an atomic access on behalf of the guest, mark the targetgfn dirty if the CMPXCHG by KVM is attempted and doesn't fault.  Thisfixes a bug where KVM effectively corrupts guest memory during livemigration by writing to guest memory without informing userspace that thepage is dirty.Marking the page dirty got unintentionally dropped when KVM's emulatedCMPXCHG was converted to do a user access.  Before that, KVM explicitlymapped the guest page into kernel memory, and marked the page dirty duringthe unmap phase.Mark the page dirty even if the CMPXCHG fails, as the old data is writtenback on failure, i.e. the page is still written.  The value written isguaranteed to be the same because the operation is atomic, but KVM's ABIis that all writes are dirty logged regardless of the value written.  Andmore importantly, that's what KVM did before the buggy commit.Huge kudos to the folks on the Cc list (and many others), who did all theactual work of triaging and debugging.base-commit: 6769ea8da8a93ed4630f1ce64df6aafcaabfce64</td>

One may identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate. Alternatively, ensure that proper permissions and directory access control are set to deny users the ability to write files to the top-level directory `C:`.

At some point the manager obviously stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory. Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources.

NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. â1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating âAn issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.â is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a âPatchâ link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.</td>

As allowed by the vendor, CVE investigated this report on 20060525 and found that the demo site demonstrated a non-sensitive SQL error when given standard SQL injection manipulations</td>

      <td>PrivateVPN 2.0.31 for macOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The software installs a privileged helper tool that runs as the root user. This privileged helper tool is installed as a LaunchDaemon and implements an XPC service. The XPC service is responsible for handling new VPN connection operations via the main PrivateVPN application. The privileged helper tool creates new VPN connections by executing the openvpn binary located in the /Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources directory. The openvpn binary can be overwritten by the default user, which allows an attacker that has already installed malicious software as the default user to replace the binary. When a new VPN connection is established, the privileged helper tool will launch this malicious binary, thus allowing an attacker to execute code as the root user. NOTE: the vendor has reportedly indicated that this behavior is "an acceptable part of their software.</td>

This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:LoongArch: Define the __io_aw() hook as mmiowb()Commit fb24ea52f78e0d595852e ("drivers: Remove explicit invocations ofmmiowb()") remove all mmiowb() in drivers, but it says:"NOTE: mmiowb() has only ever guaranteed ordering in conjunction withspin_unlock(). However, pairing each mmiowb() removal in this patch withthe corresponding call to spin_unlock() is not at all trivial, so thereis a small chance that this change may regress any drivers incorrectlyrelying on mmiowb() to order MMIO writes between CPUs using lock-freesynchronisation."The mmio in radeon_ring_commit() is protected by a mutex rather than aspinlock, but in the mutex fastpath it behaves similar to spinlock. Wecan add mmiowb() calls in the radeon driver but the maintainer says hedoesn't like such a workaround, and radeon is not the only example ofmutex protected mmio.So we should extend the mmiowb tracking system from spinlock to mutex,and maybe other locking primitives. This is not easy and error prone, sowe solve it in the architectural code, by simply defining the __io_aw()hook as mmiowb(). And we no longer need to override queued_spin_unlock()so use the generic definition.Without this, we get such an error when run 'glxgears' on weak orderingarchitectures such as LoongArch:radeon 0000:04:00.0: ring 0 stalled for more than 10324msecradeon 0000:04:00.0: ring 3 stalled for more than 10240msecradeon 0000:04:00.0: GPU lockup (current fence id 0x000000000001f412 last fence id 0x000000000001f414 on ring 3)radeon 0000:04:00.0: GPU lockup (current fence id 0x000000000000f940 last fence id 0x000000000000f941 on ring 0)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)</td>

      <td>An issue was discovered in SMA Solar Technology products. The SIP implementation does not properly use authentication with encryption: it is vulnerable to replay attacks, packet injection attacks, and man in the middle attacks. An attacker is able to successfully use SIP to communicate with the device from anywhere within the LAN. An attacker may use this to crash the device, stop it from communicating with the SMA servers, exploit known SIP vulnerabilities, or find sensitive information from the SIP communications. Furthermore, because the SIP communication channel is unencrypted, an attacker capable of understanding the protocol can eavesdrop on communications. For example, passwords can be extracted. NOTE: the vendor's position is that authentication with encryption is not required on an isolated subnetwork. Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: Fix vector state restore in rt_sigreturn()The RISC-V Vector specification states in "Appendix D: CallingConvention for Vector State" [1] that "Executing a system call causesall caller-saved vector registers (v0-v31, vl, vtype) and vstart tobecome unspecified.". In the RISC-V kernel this is called "discardingthe vstate".Returning from a signal handler via the rt_sigreturn() syscall, vectordiscard is also performed. However, this is not an issue since thevector state should be restored from the sigcontext, and therefore notcare about the vector discard.The "live state" is the actual vector register in the running context,and the "vstate" is the vector state of the task. A dirty live state,means that the vstate and live state are not in synch.When vectorized user_from_copy() was introduced, an bug sneaked in atthe restoration code, related to the discard of the live state.An example when this go wrong:  1. A userland application is executing vector code  2. The application receives a signal, and the signal handler is     entered.  3. The application returns from the signal handler, using the     rt_sigreturn() syscall.  4. The live vector state is discarded upon entering the     rt_sigreturn(), and the live state is marked as "dirty", indicating     that the live state need to be synchronized with the current     vstate.  5. rt_sigreturn() restores the vstate, except the Vector registers,     from the sigcontext  6. rt_sigreturn() restores the Vector registers, from the sigcontext,     and now the vectorized user_from_copy() is used. The dirty live     state from the discard is saved to the vstate, making the vstate     corrupt.  7. rt_sigreturn() returns to the application, which crashes due to     corrupted vstate.Note that the vectorized user_from_copy() is invoked depending on thevalue of CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_V_UCOPY_THRESHOLD. Default is 768, whichmeans that vlen has to be larger than 128b for this bug to trigger.The fix is simply to mark the live state as non-dirty/clean priorperforming the vstate restore.</td>

But the per CPU cached xfd value is notreset, which brings them out of sync.As a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to updatethe MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernelspace, which crashes the kernel.To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state togetherwith MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/sev: Fix position dependent variable references in startup codeThe early startup code executes from a 1:1 mapping of memory, whichdiffers from the mapping that the code was linked and/or relocated torun at. The latter mapping is not active yet at this point, and sosymbol references that rely on it will fault.Given that the core kernel is built without -fPIC, symbol references aretypically emitted as absolute, and so any such references occuring inthe early startup code will therefore crash the kernel.While an attempt was made to work around this for the early SEV/SMEstartup code, by forcing RIP-relative addressing for certain globalSEV/SME variables via inline assembly (see snp_cpuid_get_table() forexample), RIP-relative addressing must be pervasively enforced forSEV/SME global variables when accessed prior to page table fixups.__startup_64() already handles this issue for select non-SEV/SME globalvariables using fixup_pointer(), which adjusts the pointer relative to a`physaddr` argument. To avoid having to pass around this `physaddr`argument across all functions needing to apply pointer fixups, introducea macro RIP_RELATIVE_REF() which generates a RIP-relative reference toa given global variable. It is used where necessary to forceRIP-relative accesses to global variables.For backporting purposes, this patch makes no attempt at cleaning upother occurrences of this pattern, involving either inline asm orfixup_pointer(). Those will be addressed later.  [ bp: Call it "rip_rel_ref" everywhere like other code shortens    "rIP-relative reference" and make the asm wrapper __always_inline. ]</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/efistub: Call mixed mode boot services on the firmware's stackNormally, the EFI stub calls into the EFI boot services using the stackthat was live when the stub was entered. According to the UEFI spec,this stack needs to be at least 128k in size - this might seem large butall asynchronous processing and event handling in EFI runs from the samestack and so quite a lot of space may be used in practice.In mixed mode, the situation is a bit different: the bootloader callsthe 32-bit EFI stub entry point, which calls the decompressor's 32-bitentry point, where the boot stack is set up, using a fixed allocationof 16k. This stack is still in use when the EFI stub is started in64-bit mode, and so all calls back into the EFI firmware will be usingthe decompressor's limited boot stack.Due to the placement of the boot stack right after the boot heap, anystack overruns have gone unnoticed. However, commit  5c4feadb0011983b ("x86/decompressor: Move global symbol references to C code")moved the definition of the boot heap into C code, and now the bootstack is placed right at the base of BSS, where any overruns willcorrupt the end of the .data section.While it would be possible to work around this by increasing the size ofthe boot stack, doing so would affect all x86 systems, and mixed modesystems are a tiny (and shrinking) fraction of the x86 installed base.So instead, record the firmware stack pointer value when entering fromthe 32-bit firmware, and switch to this stack every time a EFI bootservice call is made.</td>
