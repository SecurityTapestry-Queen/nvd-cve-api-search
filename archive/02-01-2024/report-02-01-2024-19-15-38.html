That user input is filtered insufficiently, which makes it is possible to send requests to unintended network locations and receive responses. On sites in a cloud environment like AWS, an attacker can potentially make GET requests to the instance's metadata REST API. If the instance's configuration is insecure, this can lead to the exposure of internal data, including credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.5.</td>

Additionally, if used with an Airflow version between 2.3.0 and 2.6.0, the configuration dictionary will be logged as plain text in the triggerer service without masking. This allows anyone with access to the metadata or triggerer log to obtain the configuration file and use it to access the Kubernetes cluster.This behavior was changed in version 7.0.0, which stopped serializing the file contents and started providing the file path instead to read the contents into the trigger.

When mod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionType server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to `hiredis`, which would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled format string bug. Initial assessment shows that this bug does not appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers. This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to `on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this option is enabled.</td>

      <td>Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. The Argo CD API prior to versions 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15 are vulnerable to a cross-server request forgery (CSRF) attack when the attacker has the ability to write HTML to a page on the same parent domain as Argo CD. A CSRF attack works by tricking an authenticated Argo CD user into loading a web page which contains code to call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim’s behalf. For example, an attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a page which looks harmless but in the background calls an Argo CD API endpoint to create an application running malicious code. Argo CD uses the “Lax” SameSite cookie policy to prevent CSRF attacks where the attacker controls an external domain. The malicious external website can attempt to call the Argo CD API, but the web browser will refuse to send the Argo CD auth token with the request. Many companies host Argo CD on an internal subdomain. If an attacker can place malicious code on, for example, https://test.internal.example.com/, they can still perform a CSRF attack. In this case, the “Lax” SameSite cookie does not prevent the browser from sending the auth cookie, because the destination is a parent domain of the Argo CD API. Browsers generally block such attacks by applying CORS policies to sensitive requests with sensitive content types. Specifically, browsers will send a “preflight request” for POSTs with content type “application/json” asking the destination API “are you allowed to accept requests from my domain?” If the destination API does not answer “yes,” the browser will block the request. Before the patched versions, Argo CD did not validate that requests contained the correct content type header. So an attacker could bypass the browser’s CORS check by setting the content type to something which is considered “not sensitive” such as “text/plain.” The browser wouldn’t send the preflight request, and Argo CD would happily accept the contents (which are actually still JSON) and perform the requested action (such as running malicious code). A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15. The patch contains a breaking API change. The Argo CD API will no longer accept non-GET requests which do not specify application/json as their Content-Type. The accepted content types list is configurable, and it is possible (but discouraged) to disable the content type check completely. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>

      <td>Django</td>
      <td>Label Studio is an a popular open source data labeling tool. Versions prior to 1.9.2 have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited when an authenticated user uploads a crafted image file for their avatar that gets rendered as a HTML file on the website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.The file `users/functions.py` lines 18-49 show that the only verification check is that the file is an image by extracting the dimensions from the file. Label Studio serves avatar images using Django's built-in `serve` view, which is not secure for production use according to Django's documentation. The issue with the Django `serve` view is that it determines the `Content-Type` of the response by the file extension in the URL path. Therefore, an attacker can upload an image that contains malicious HTML code and name the file with a `.html` extension to be rendered as a HTML page. The only file extension validation is performed on the client-side, which can be easily bypassed.Version 1.9.2 fixes this issue. Other remediation strategies include validating the file extension on the server side, not in client-side code; removing the use of Django's `serve` view and implement a secure controller for viewing uploaded avatar images; saving file content in the database rather than on the filesystem to mitigate against other file related vulnerabilities; and avoiding trusting user controlled inputs.</td>

      <td>Label Studio, an open source data labeling tool had a remote import feature allowed users to import data from a remote web source, that was downloaded and could be viewed on the website. Prior to version 1.10.1, this feature could had been abused to download a HTML file that executed malicious JavaScript code in the context of the Label Studio website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.`data_import/uploader.py` lines 125C5 through 146 showed that if a URL passed the server side request forgery verification checks, the contents of the file would be downloaded using the filename in the URL. The downloaded file path could then be retrieved by sending a request to `/api/projects/{project_id}/file-uploads?ids=[{download_id}]` where `{project_id}` was the ID of the project and `{download_id}` was the ID of the downloaded file. Once the downloaded file path was retrieved by the previous API endpoint, `data_import/api.py`lines 595C1 through 616C62 demonstrated that the `Content-Type` of the response was determined by the file extension, since `mimetypes.guess_type` guesses the `Content-Type` based on the file extension. Since the `Content-Type` was determined by the file extension of the downloaded file, an attacker could import in a `.html` file that would execute JavaScript when visited.Version 1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue. Other remediation strategies are also available. For all user provided files that are downloaded by Label Studio, set the `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox;` response header when viewed on the site. The `sandbox` directive restricts a page's actions to prevent popups, execution of plugins and scripts and enforces a `same-origin` policy. Alternatively, restrict the allowed file extensions that may be downloaded.</td>

      <td>Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.</td>

The root cause is that the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't properly adhere to the API of copy functions (for `&gt;=0.3.2` the `copy_bytes` function). A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The buffer overflow can result in the change of semantics of the contract. The overflow is length-dependent and thus it might go unnoticed during contract testing. However, certainly not all usages of concat will result in overwritten valid data as we require it to be in an internal function and close to the return statement where other memory allocations don't occur. This issue has been addressed in commit `55e18f6d1` which will be included in future releases. Users are advised to update when possible.</td>

      <td>The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

      <td>Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin "Text". The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. Another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on "Markdown" or "HTML" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. This issue has been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.</td>

Continued BGP session flapping will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue only affects routers configured with non-stop routing (NSR) enabled. Graceful Restart (GR) helper mode, enabled by default, is also required for this issue to be exploitable.Note: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.When the BGP session flaps on the NSR-enabled router, the device enters GR-helper/LLGR-helper mode due to the peer having negotiated GR/LLGR-restarter capability and the backup BGP requests for replication of the GR/LLGR-helper session, master BGP schedules, and initiates replication of GR/LLGR stale routes to the backup BGP. In this state, if the BGP session with the BGP peer comes up again, unsolicited replication is initiated for the peer without cleaning up the ongoing GR/LLGR-helper mode replication. This parallel two instances of replication for the same peer leads to the assert if the BGP session flaps again.This issue affects:Juniper Networks Junos OS  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S9;  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5;  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S1;  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3;  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1, 23.2R2.Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved  *  All versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5-EVO;  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5-EVO;  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4-EVO;  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3-EVO;  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S1-EVO;  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-S2-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO;  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.</td>

      <td>@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called "double dots", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.</td>

      <td>Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key andinitialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncationor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() orEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed afterthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,via the "keylen" parameter or the IV length, via the "ivlen" parameter,within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentiallycausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphersand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result inloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38Dsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES inGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV willproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memoryexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as securitycritical.Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operationand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely thatapplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing sincedecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarlyvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application beingvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable thenthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed thisissue as Moderate severity overall.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this becausethe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.</td>

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, butOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointerdereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application willbe vulnerable to this issue.OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()and PKCS12_newpass().We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7().
