CVE-2024-4254,4.2,AWS,"The 'deploy-website.yml' workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically in the 'main' branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to improper authorization. The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN, AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.",2024-06-04T16:57:41.053,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-4254
CVE-2024-4084,4.0,AWS,"A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the latest version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing attackers to bypass the official fix intended to restrict access to intranet IP addresses and protocols. Despite efforts to filter out intranet IP addresses starting with 192, 172, 10, and 127 through regular expressions and limit access protocols to HTTP and HTTPS, attackers can still bypass these restrictions using alternative representations of IP addresses and accessing other ports running on localhost. This vulnerability enables attackers to access any asset on the internal network, attack web services on the internal network, scan hosts on the internal network, and potentially access AWS metadata endpoints. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, which can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.",2024-06-05T12:53:50.240,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-4084

CVE-2018-11770,2.5,Apache,"From version 1.3.0 onward, Apache Spark's standalone master exposes a REST API for job submission, in addition to the submission mechanism used by spark-submit. In standalone, the config property 'spark.authenticate.secret' establishes a shared secret for authenticating requests to submit jobs via spark-submit. However, the REST API does not use this or any other authentication mechanism, and this is not adequately documented. In this case, a user would be able to run a driver program without authenticating, but not launch executors, using the REST API. This REST API is also used by Mesos, when set up to run in cluster mode (i.e., when also running MesosClusterDispatcher), for job submission. Future versions of Spark will improve documentation on these points, and prohibit setting 'spark.authenticate.secret' when running the REST APIs, to make this clear. Future versions will also disable the REST API by default in the standalone master by changing the default value of 'spark.master.rest.enabled' to 'false'.",2024-06-10T19:15:17.827,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-11770

CVE-2021-47546,3.6,Firewall,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv6: fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppressThe kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftablesfirewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routingrules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such scenarios, everyincoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I trackeddown the issue to ca7a03c41753 (""ipv6: do not free rt ifFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule"").The problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` notdecreasing the refcount when needed.How to reproduce: - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop   This can be done with:     sudo nft create table inet test     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop - Run:     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0 - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase   with every incoming ipv6 packet.This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocolspecific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the genericFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.[1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L71[2]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L99",2024-06-10T18:30:20.320,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47546

CVE-2022-39253,3.6,Repository,"Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system. Versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4 are subject to exposure of sensitive information to a malicious actor. When performing a local clone (where the source and target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents of the source's `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.",2024-06-10T18:15:19.643,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-39253

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a ""proper"" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future.
