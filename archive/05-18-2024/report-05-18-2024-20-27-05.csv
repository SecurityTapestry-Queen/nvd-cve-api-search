Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can't do anything about a manager running out of memory and not being able to add new legitimate nodes to the system.

CVE-2020-11710,5.9,Docker,"An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949) Lastly, the hyperlink to https://github.com/Kong/kong (an unrelated Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any meaningful information on this topic.",2024-05-17T01:41:41.890,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-11710

However, pairing each mmiowb() removal in this patch withthe corresponding call to spin_unlock() is not at all trivial, so thereis a small chance that this change may regress any drivers incorrectlyrelying on mmiowb() to order MMIO writes between CPUs using lock-freesynchronisation.""The mmio in radeon_ring_commit() is protected by a mutex rather than aspinlock, but in the mutex fastpath it behaves similar to spinlock. Wecan add mmiowb() calls in the radeon driver but the maintainer says hedoesn't like such a workaround, and radeon is not the only example ofmutex protected mmio.So we should extend the mmiowb tracking system from spinlock to mutex,and maybe other locking primitives. This is not easy and error prone, sowe solve it in the architectural code, by simply defining the __io_aw()hook as mmiowb(). And we no longer need to override queued_spin_unlock()so use the generic definition.Without this, we get such an error when run 'glxgears' on weak orderingarchitectures such as LoongArch:radeon 0000:04:00.0: ring 0 stalled for more than 10324msecradeon 0000:04:00.0: ring 3 stalled for more than 10240msecradeon 0000:04:00.0: GPU lockup (current fence id 0x000000000001f412 last fence id 0x000000000001f414 on ring 3)radeon 0000:04:00.0: GPU lockup (current fence id 0x000000000000f940 last fence id 0x000000000000f941 on ring 0)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)radeon 0000:04:00.0: scheduling IB failed (-35).[drm:radeon_gem_va_ioctl [radeon]] *ERROR* Couldn't update BO_VA (-35)",2024-05-17T18:35:35.070,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35818

CVE-2024-26991,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86/mmu: x86: Don't overflow lpage_info when checking attributesFix KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES to not overflow lpage_info array and triggerKASAN splat, as seen in the private_mem_conversions_test selftest.When memory attributes are set on a GFN range, that range will havespecific properties applied to the TDP. A huge page cannot be used whenthe attributes are inconsistent, so they are disabled for those thespecific huge pages. For internal KVM reasons, huge pages are also notallowed to span adjacent memslots regardless of whether the backing memorycould be mapped as huge.What GFNs support which huge page sizes is tracked by an array of arrays'lpage_info' on the memslot, of ‘kvm_lpage_info’ structs. Each index oflpage_info contains a vmalloc allocated array of these for a specificsupported page size. The kvm_lpage_info denotes whether a specific hugepage (GFN and page size) on the memslot is supported. These arrays includeindices for unaligned head and tail huge pages.Preventing huge pages from spanning adjacent memslot is covered byincrementing the count in head and tail kvm_lpage_info when the memslot isallocated, but disallowing huge pages for memory that has mixed attributeshas to be done in a more complicated way. During theKVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES ioctl KVM updates lpage_info for each memslot inthe range that has mismatched attributes. KVM does this a memslot at atime, and marks a special bit, KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG, in the kvm_lpage_infofor any huge page. This bit is essentially a permanently elevated count.So huge pages will not be mapped for the GFN at that page size if thecount is elevated in either case: a huge head or tail page unaligned tothe memslot or if KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is set because it has mixedattributes.To determine whether a huge page has consistent attributes, theKVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES operation checks an xarray to make sure itconsistently has the incoming attribute. Since level - 1 huge pages arealigned to level huge pages, it employs an optimization. As long as thelevel - 1 huge pages are checked first, it can just check these and assumethat if each level - 1 huge page contained within the level sized hugepage is not mixed, then the level size huge page is not mixed. Thisoptimization happens in the helper hugepage_has_attrs().Unfortunately, although the kvm_lpage_info array representing page size'level' will contain an entry for an unaligned tail page of size level,the array for level - 1  will not contain an entry for each GFN at pagesize level. The level - 1 array will only contain an index for anyunaligned region covered by level - 1 huge page size, which can be asmaller region. So this causes the optimization to overflow the level - 1kvm_lpage_info and perform a vmalloc out of bounds read.In some cases of head and tail pages where an overflow could happen,callers skip the operation completely as KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is notrequired to prevent huge pages as discussed earlier. But for memslots thatare smaller than the 1GB page size, it does call hugepage_has_attrs(). Inthis case the huge page is both the head and tail page. The issue can beobserved simply by compiling the kernel with CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC andrunning the selftest “private_mem_conversions_test”, which produces theoutput like the following:BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in hugepage_has_attrs+0x7e/0x110Read of size 4 at addr ffffc900000a3008 by task private_mem_con/169Call Trace:  dump_stack_lvl  print_report  ? __virt_addr_valid  ? hugepage_has_attrs  ? hugepage_has_attrs  kasan_report  ? hugepage_has_attrs  hugepage_has_attrs  kvm_arch_post_set_memory_attributes  kvm_vm_ioctlIt is a little ambiguous whether the unaligned head page (in the bug casealso the tail page) should be expected to have KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG set.It is not functionally required, as the unal---truncated---",2024-05-13T08:15:11.137,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26991
CVE-2024-26992,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86/pmu: Disable support for adaptive PEBSDrop support for virtualizing adaptive PEBS, as KVM's implementation isarchitecturally broken without an obvious/easy path forward, and becauseexposing adaptive PEBS can leak host LBRs to the guest, i.e. can leakhost kernel addresses to the guest.Bug #1 is that KVM doesn't account for the upper 32 bits ofIA32_FIXED_CTR_CTRL when (re)programming fixed counters, e.gfixed_ctrl_field() drops the upper bits, reprogram_fixed_counters()stores local variables as u8s and truncates the upper bits too, etc.Bug #2 is that, because KVM _always_ sets precise_ip to a non-zero valuefor PEBS events, perf will _always_ generate an adaptive record, even ifthe guest requested a basic record.  Note, KVM will also enable adaptivePEBS in individual *counter*, even if adaptive PEBS isn't exposed to theguest, but this is benign as MSR_PEBS_DATA_CFG is guaranteed to be zero,i.e. the guest will only ever see Basic records.Bug #3 is in perf.  intel_pmu_disable_fixed() doesn't clear the upperbits either, i.e. leaves ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE set, andintel_pmu_enable_fixed() effectively doesn't clear ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVEeither.  I.e. perf _always_ enables ADAPTIVE counters, regardless of whatKVM requests.Bug #4 is that adaptive PEBS *might* effectively bypass event filters setby the host, as ""Updated Memory Access Info Group"" records informationthat might be disallowed by userspace via KVM_SET_PMU_EVENT_FILTER.Bug #5 is that KVM doesn't ensure LBR MSRs hold guest values (or at leastzeros) when entering a vCPU with adaptive PEBS, which allows the guestto read host LBRs, i.e. host RIPs/addresses, by enabling ""LBR Entries""records.Disable adaptive PEBS support as an immediate fix due to the severity ofthe LBR leak in particular, and because fixing all of the bugs will benon-trivial, e.g. not suitable for backporting to stable kernels.Note!  This will break live migration, but trying to make KVM play nicewith live migration would be quite complicated, wouldn't be guaranteed towork (i.e. KVM might still kill/confuse the guest), and it's not clearthat there are any publicly available VMMs that support adaptive PEBS,let alone live migrate VMs that support adaptive PEBS, e.g. QEMU doesn'tsupport PEBS in any capacity.",2024-05-13T08:15:11.193,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26992
