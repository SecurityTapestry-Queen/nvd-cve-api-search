Prior to versions 1.0.3 and 2.9.2, when a response is processed, the issuer of the Identity Provider is not sufficiently validated. This could allow a malicious identity provider to craft a Saml2 response that is processed as if issued by another identity provider. It is also possible for a malicious end user to cause stored state intended for one identity provider to be used when processing the response from another provider. An application is impacted if they rely on any of these features in their authentication/authorization logic: the issuer of the generated identity and claims; or items in the stored request state (AuthenticationProperties). This issue is patched in versions 2.9.2 and 1.0.3. The `AcsCommandResultCreated` notification can be used to add the validation required if an upgrade to patched packages is not possible.</td>

This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) between the remote access VPN feature and the HTTPS management and site-to-site VPN features. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials.

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.Swarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.The overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.Encrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.When setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.Two iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.The injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.Patches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.Some workarounds are available.

As a result, `overlay` networks may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees.It is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc. are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may use Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due to this vulnerability this is no longer guaranteed.Patches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24.

      <td>containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18 where supplementary groups are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. Downstream applications that use the containerd client library may be affected as well.This bug has been fixed in containerd v1.6.18 and v.1.5.18. Users should update to these versions and recreate containers to resolve this issue. Users who rely on a downstream application that uses containerd's client library should check that application for a separate advisory and instructions. As a workaround, ensure that the `"USER $USERNAME"` Dockerfile instruction is not used. Instead, set the container entrypoint to a value similar to `ENTRYPOINT ["su", "-", "user"]` to allow `su` to properly set up supplementary groups.</td>

This can be exploited for remote code execution (RCE), for instance if the file written outside the working tree is a git filter that gets executed on a subsequent git command.The issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The user performing the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git configuration.Setting git configuration option core.symlinks = false before checking out avoids the problem.The issue was fixed in Eclipse JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via  Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/  and  repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ .The JGit maintainers would like to thank RyotaK for finding and reporting this issue.</td>

In version 0.3.9 and prior, under certain conditions, the memory used by the builtins `raw_call`, `create_from_blueprint` and `create_copy_of` can be corrupted. For `raw_call`, the argument buffer of the call can be corrupted, leading to incorrect `calldata` in the sub-context. For `create_from_blueprint` and `create_copy_of`, the buffer for the to-be-deployed bytecode can be corrupted, leading to deploying incorrect bytecode.Each builtin has conditions that must be fulfilled for the corruption to happen. For `raw_call`, the `data` argument of the builtin must be `msg.data` and the `value` or `gas` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory. For `create_copy_of`, the `value` or `salt` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory. For `create_from_blueprint`, either no constructor parameters should be passed to the builtin or `raw_args` should be set to True, and the `value` or `salt` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory.As of time of publication, no patched version exists. The issue is still being investigated, and there might be other cases where the corruption might happen. When the builtin is being called from an `internal` function `F`, the issue is not present provided that the function calling `F` wrote to memory before calling `F`. As a workaround, the complex expressions that are being passed as kwargs to the builtin should be cached in memory prior to the call to the builtin.</td>

An attacker who has the ability to write to an account can exploit this to perform a denial-of-service attack by adding an SPN that matches an existing service. Additionally, an attacker who can intercept traffic can impersonate existing services, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity.</td>

This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

Before returning tothe caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring theirprevious content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processorssupporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized sothe attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence,if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependentcalculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEADcipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications usingOpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware ofany concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore weconsider this a Low severity security issue.As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled atruntime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL_ia32cap:   OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.</td>

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)</td>

      <td>1.4</td>
      <td>X86</td>
      <td>Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime versions from 10.0.0 to versions 10.02, 11.0.2, and 12.0.1 contain a miscompilation of the WebAssembly `i64x2.shr_s` instruction on x86_64 platforms when the shift amount is a constant value that is larger than 32. Only x86_64 is affected so all other targets are not affected by this. The miscompilation results in the instruction producing an incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second lane of the vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the input vector instead of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this issue is that any WebAssembly program using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce an incorrect result.This issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox. Execution of WebAssembly guest programs will still behave correctly with respect to memory sandboxing and isolation from the host. Wasmtime considers non-spec-compliant behavior as a security issue nonetheless.This issue was discovered through fuzzing of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.Wasmtime versions 10.0.2, 11.0.2, and 12.0.2 are all patched to no longer have this miscompilation. This issue only affects x86_64 hosts and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm modules which is nontrivial or to disable the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly. Users prior to 10.0.0 are unaffected by this vulnerability.</td>
