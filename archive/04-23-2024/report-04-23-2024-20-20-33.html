You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or change your "expose_config" configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different to  CVE-2023-46288 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq  which concerned API, not UI configuration page.</td>

In 26.0.0, IPv6 is not disabled on network interfaces, including those belonging to networks where `--ipv6=false`. An container with an `ipvlan` or `macvlan` interface will normally be configured to share an external network link with the host machine. Because of this direct access, (1) Containers may be able to communicate with other hosts on the local network over link-local IPv6 addresses, (2) if router advertisements are being broadcast over the local network, containers may get SLAAC-assigned addresses, and (3) the interface  will be a member of IPv6 multicast groups. This means interfaces in IPv4-only networks present an unexpectedly and unnecessarily increased attack surface. The issue is patched in 26.0.2. To completely disable IPv6 in a container, use `--sysctl=net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1` in the `docker create` or `docker run` command. Or, in the service configuration of a `compose` file.</td>

Prior to 1.4.0, the safe_scrape_html function utilizes a user-controlled URL to issue a request to a remote server, however these requests are not rate-limited. While there are efforts to prevent DDoS by implementing a timeout on requests, it is possible for an attacker to issue a large number of requests to the server which will be handled in batches based on the configuration of the Mealie server. The chunking of responses is helpful for mitigating memory exhaustion on the Mealie server, however a single request to an arbitrarily large external file (e.g. a Debian ISO) is often sufficient to completely saturate a CPU core assigned to the Mealie container. Without rate limiting in place, it is possible to not only sustain traffic against an external target indefinitely, but also to exhaust the CPU resources assigned to the Mealie container.

Prior to 17.0.0, there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one, we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method, we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and, **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage`, we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction, but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change, it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.  The issue has been patched in versions &gt;=V17.0.0.</td>

Supported versions that are affected are 11.5.10, 12.1 and 12.2. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Complex Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul accessible data.

      <td>The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that "(appropriately) short exponents" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.</td>

      <td>An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:PCI: Fix active state requirement in PME pollingThe commit noted in fixes added a bogus requirement that runtime PM manageddevices need to be in the RPM_ACTIVE state for PME polling.  In fact, onlydevices in low power states should be polled.However there's still a requirement that the device config space must beaccessible, which has implications for both the current state of the polleddevice and the parent bridge, when present.  It's not sufficient to assumethe bridge remains in D0 and cases have been observed where the bridgepasses the D0 test, but the PM state indicates RPM_SUSPENDING and configspace of the polled device becomes inaccessible during pci_pme_wakeup().Therefore, since the bridge is already effectively required to be in theRPM_ACTIVE state, formalize this in the code and elevate the PM usage countto maintain the state while polling the subordinate device.This resolves a regression reported in the bugzilla below where aThunderbolt/USB4 hierarchy fails to scan for an attached NVMe endpointdownstream of a bridge in a D3hot power state.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix drm bridge use-after-freeA recent DRM series purporting to simplify support for "transparentbridges" and handling of probe deferrals ironically exposed ause-after-free issue on pmic_glink_altmode probe deferral.This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failingto initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines likethe Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before allresources have been acquired which means that it can also bederegistered on probe deferrals.In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver(or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge andstored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about tobe deallocated.When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers ause-after-free when attaching the bridges:\tdp -&gt; aux -&gt; dp-hpd (freed)which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:\t[drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16or a NULL-pointer dereference:\tUnable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000\t...\tCall trace:\t  drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]\t  drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]\t  drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]\t  dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]\t  msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built onthe assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix isto move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver toafter all resources have been looked up.Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registerschild devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issuein driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (seecommit fbc35b45f9f6 ("Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER")).[DB: slightly fixed commit message by adding the word 'commit']</td>

      <td>An issue was discovered in a third-party com.factory.mmigroup component, shipped on devices from multiple device manufacturers. Certain software builds for various Android devices contain a vulnerable pre-installed app with a package name of com.factory.mmigroup (versionCode='3', versionName='2.1) that allows local third-party apps to perform various actions, due to inadequate access control, in its context (system user), but the functionalities exposed depend on the specific device. The following capabilities are exposed to zero-permission, third-party apps on the following devices: arbitrary AT command execution via AT command injection (T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, and Boost Mobile Celero 5G); programmatic factory reset (Samsung Galaxy A03S, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, Realme C25Y, and Lenovo Tab M8 HD), leaking IMEI (Samsung Galaxy A03S, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, and Realme C25Y); leaking serial number (Samsung Galaxy A03s, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, Realme C25Y, and Lenovo Tab M8 HD); powering off the device (Realme C25Y, Samsung Galaxy A03S, and T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G); and programmatically enabling/disabling airplane mode (Samsung Galaxy A03S, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, and Realme C25Y); and enabling Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS (Samsung Galaxy A03S, T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G, T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G, Boost Mobile Celero, and Realme C25Y). No permissions or special privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerabilities in the com.factory.mmigroup app. No user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows: Boost Mobile Celero 5G (Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V067:user/release-keys, Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V064:user/release-keys, Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V061:user/release-keys, and Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V052:user/release-keys); Samsung Galaxy A03S (samsung/a03sutfn/a03su:13/TP1A.220624.014/S134DLUDU6CWB6:user/release-keys and samsung/a03sutfn/a03su:12/SP1A.210812.016/S134DLUDS5BWA1:user/release-keys); Lenovo Tab M8 HD (Lenovo/LenovoTB-8505F/8505F:10/QP1A.190711.020/S300637_220706_BMP:user/release-keys and Lenovo/LenovoTB-8505F/8505F:10/QP1A.190711.020/S300448_220114_BMP:user/release-keys); T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G (T-Mobile/Augusta/Augusta:12/SP1A.210812.016/SW_S98121AA1_V070:user/release-keys and T-Mobile/Augusta/Augusta:12/SP1A.210812.016/SW_S98121AA1_V066:user/release-keys); T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G (T-Mobile/Sprout/Sprout:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98115AA1_V077:user/release-keys and T-Mobile/Sprout/Sprout:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98115AA1_V060:user/release-keys); and Realme C25Y (realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1675861640000:user/release-keys, realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1664031768000:user/release-keys, realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1652814687000:user/release-keys, and realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1635785712000:user/release-keys). This malicious app sends a broadcast Intent to com.factory.mmigroup/.MMIGroupReceiver. This causes the com.factory.mmigroup app to dynamically register for various action strings. The malicious app can then send these strings, allowing it to perform various behaviors that the com.factory.mmigroup app exposes. The actual behaviors exposed by the com.factory.mmigroup app depend on device model and chipset. The com.factory.mmigroup app executes as the "system" user, allowing it to interact with the baseband processor and perform various other sensitive actions.</td>

This allows an attacker with local access to a machine with the logging.json file to use that key to authenticate to the platform with high privileges.  This was fixed in the Rapid7 platform starting 3 April 2024 via the introduction of a restricted role and the removal of automatic API key generation on installation of an agent.</td>

      <td>SSH</td>
      <td>In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.</td>

However, because ofthe order in which things are initialised, this is not guaranteed to be thecase, because the device is exposed to the USB subsystem before the ath9k driverinitialisation is completed.We already committed a partial fix for this in commit:8b3046abc99e ("ath9k_htc: fix NULL pointer dereference at ath9k_htc_tx_get_packet()")However, that commit only aborted the WMI_TXSTATUS_EVENTID command in the eventtasklet, pairing it with an "initialisation complete" bit in the TX struct. Itseems syzbot managed to trigger the race for one of the other commands as well,so let's just move the existing synchronisation bit to cover the wholetasklet (setting it at the end of ath9k_htc_probe_device() instead of insideath9k_tx_init()).</td>
