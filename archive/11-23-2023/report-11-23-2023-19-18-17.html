      <td>NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology, built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and edge computing. The cryptographic key handling library, nkeys, recently gained support for encryption, not just for signing/authentication. This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys versions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5, corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3, the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handling logic mistakenly passed an array by value into an internal function, where the function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. As a result, all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects encryption only, not signing.  FIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTH CALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys Go library 0.4.6, corresponding with NATS Server 2.10.4, has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. For any application handling auth callouts in Go, if using the nkeys library, update the dependency, recompile and deploy that in lockstep.</td>

      <td>A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.</td>

This is a use-after-free bug that impacts the entire cupsd process.The exact cause of this issue is the function `httpClose(con-&gt;http)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`. The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument is not null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address (HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.Version 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.</td>

Node.js prevents path traversal through strings (see CVE-2023-30584) and `Buffer` objects (see CVE-2023-32004), but not through non-`Buffer` `Uint8Array` objects.This is distinct from CVE-2023-32004 which only referred to `Buffer` objects. However, the vulnerability follows the same pattern using `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`.Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.</td>

      <td>Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checkingexcessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() togenerate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays.  Likewise, applicationsthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained froman untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is thereforevulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively largeP, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.An application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() andsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could bevulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number ofother OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those otherfunctions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by thisare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the"-pubcheck" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.</td>

This disruption is triggered by a "sleep()" call in the "dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()" function under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls to the "rpcecho" server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC.
