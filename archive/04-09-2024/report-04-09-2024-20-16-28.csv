The functiontasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the taskletcallback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback freesthe structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that mayfree it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, butit is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memorywith every tasklet-processed bio.There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. Theywill have better interface and they will not suffer from the memorycorruption problem.But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can bebackported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit thatdisables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn'tremove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused whenatomic workqueues will be implemented.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/d390d7ee-f142-44d3-822a-87949e14608b@suse.de/T/[2] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240130091300.2968534-1-tj@kernel.org/",2024-04-03T17:24:18.150,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26718

The igate mutex cannot be acquired from theatomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfdrelative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible withexisting userspace.As a result, the solution implemented here moves configuration of theINTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context objectand irq_type configuration, rather than registration of a particulartrigger eventfd.

CVE-2023-20269,5.2,Cisco,"A vulnerability in the remote access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a brute force attack in an attempt to identify valid username and password combinations or an authenticated, remote attacker to establish a clientless SSL VPN session with an unauthorized user. This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) between the remote access VPN feature and the HTTPS management and site-to-site VPN features. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by specifying a default connection profile/tunnel group while conducting a brute force attack or while establishing a clientless SSL VPN session using valid credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to achieve one or both of the following:  Identify valid credentials that could then be used to establish an unauthorized remote access VPN session. Establish a clientless SSL VPN session (only when running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16 or earlier).  Notes:  Establishing a client-based remote access VPN tunnel is not possible as these default connection profiles/tunnel groups do not and cannot have an IP address pool configured. This vulnerability does not allow an attacker to bypass authentication. To successfully establish a remote access VPN session, valid credentials are required, including a valid second factor if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is configured.

Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, letthe remainder cpus stay in BIOS.The potential crash reason is that the array acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] canbe overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it is obvious that CORE_PICshould be corresponding to physical core rather than logical core, so itis better to define the array as acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC].With the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpus with qemu parameter -smp 128,otherwise system will crash with the following message.[    0.000000] CPU 0 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000420000004259, era == 90000000037a5f0c, ra == 90000000037a46ec[    0.000000] Oops[#1]:[    0.000000] CPU: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper Not tainted 6.8.0-rc2+ #192[    0.000000] Hardware name: QEMU QEMU Virtual Machine, BIOS unknown 2/2/2022[    0.000000] pc 90000000037a5f0c ra 90000000037a46ec tp 9000000003c90000 sp 9000000003c93d60[    0.000000] a0 0000000000000019 a1 9000000003d93bc0 a2 0000000000000000 a3 9000000003c93bd8[    0.000000] a4 9000000003c93a74 a5 9000000083c93a67 a6 9000000003c938f0 a7 0000000000000005[    0.000000] t0 0000420000004201 t1 0000000000000000 t2 0000000000000001 t3 0000000000000001[    0.000000] t4 0000000000000003 t5 0000000000000000 t6 0000000000000030 t7 0000000000000063[    0.000000] t8 0000000000000014 u0 ffffffffffffffff s9 0000000000000000 s0 9000000003caee98[    0.000000] s1 90000000041b0480 s2 9000000003c93da0 s3 9000000003c93d98 s4 9000000003c93d90[    0.000000] s5 9000000003caa000 s6 000000000a7fd000 s7 000000000f556b60 s8 000000000e0a4330[    0.000000]    ra: 90000000037a46ec platform_init+0x214/0x250[    0.000000]   ERA: 90000000037a5f0c efi_runtime_init+0x30/0x94[    0.000000]  CRMD: 000000b0 (PLV0 -IE -DA +PG DACF=CC DACM=CC -WE)[    0.000000]  PRMD: 00000000 (PPLV0 -PIE -PWE)[    0.000000]  EUEN: 00000000 (-FPE -SXE -ASXE -BTE)[    0.000000]  ECFG: 00070800 (LIE=11 VS=7)[    0.000000] ESTAT: 00010000 [PIL] (IS= ECode=1 EsubCode=0)[    0.000000]  BADV: 0000420000004259[    0.000000]  PRID: 0014c010 (Loongson-64bit, Loongson-3A5000)[    0.000000] Modules linked in:[    0.000000] Process swapper (pid: 0, threadinfo=(____ptrval____), task=(____ptrval____))[    0.000000] Stack : 9000000003c93a14 9000000003800898 90000000041844f8 90000000037a46ec[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 0000000008290000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000[    0.000000]         0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000019d8000 000000000f556b60[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 000000000f556b08 9000000003ca7700 9000000003800000[    0.000000]         9000000003c93e50 9000000003800898 9000000003800108 90000000037a484c[    0.000000]         000000000e0a4330 000000000f556b60 000000000a7fd000 000000000f556b08[    0.000000]         9000000003ca7700 9000000004184000 0000000000200000 000000000e02b018[    0.000000]         000000000a7fd000 90000000037a0790 9000000003800108 0000000000000000[    0.000000]         0000000000000000 000000000e0a4330 000000000f556b60 000000000a7fd000[    0.000000]         000000000f556b08 000000000eaae298 000000000eaa5040 0000000000200000[    0.000000]         ...[    0.000000] Call Trace:[    0.000000] [<90000000037a5f0c>] efi_runtime_init+0x30/0x94[    0.000000] [<90000000037a46ec>] platform_init+0x214/0x250[    0.000000] [<90000000037a484c>] setup_arch+0x124/0x45c[    0.000000] [<90000000037a0790>] start_kernel+0x90/0x670[    0.000000] [<900000000378b0d8>] kernel_entry+0xd8/0xdc",2024-04-03T17:24:18.150,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26768

This vulnerability resides in the exception handling mechanism, specifically when not operating in DEV_MODE. The system saves exception details into a session array without proper sanitization or encoding. These details are later rendered into HTML and executed in a JavaScript block within the user's browser, without adequate escaping of HTML entities. This flaw allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers can inject malicious scripts into the admin panel by triggering exceptions with controlled input. The exploitation method involves using any function that might throw an exception with user-controllable argument. This issue can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized administrative actions, posing a significant security risk.

CVE-2023-45288,NA,Endpoint,"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.",2024-04-05T12:40:52.763,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-45288

If we free sucha skb in the list_for_each_entry_safe(), the current and next sockets couldbe unlinked in a single iteration.unix_notinflight() uses list_del_init() to unlink the socket, so theprefetched next socket forms a loop itself and list_for_each_entry_safe()never stops.Here, we must use while() and make sure we always fetch the first socket.[0]:Sending NMI from CPU 0 to CPUs 1:NMI backtrace for cpu 1CPU: 1 PID: 5065 Comm: syz-executor236 Not tainted 6.8.0-rc3-syzkaller-00136-g1f719a2f3fa6 #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/25/2024RIP: 0010:preempt_count arch/x86/include/asm/preempt.h:26 [inline]RIP: 0010:check_kcov_mode kernel/kcov.c:173 [inline]RIP: 0010:__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc+0xd/0x60 kernel/kcov.c:207Code: cc cc cc cc 66 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 f3 0f 1e fa 65 48 8b 14 25 40 c2 03 00 <65> 8b 05 b4 7c 78 7e a9 00 01 ff 00 48 8b 34 24 74 0f f6 c4 01 74RSP: 0018:ffffc900033efa58 EFLAGS: 00000283RAX: ffff88807b077800 RBX: ffff88807b077800 RCX: 1ffffffff27b1189RDX: ffff88802a5a3b80 RSI: ffffffff8968488d RDI: ffff88807b077f70RBP: ffffc900033efbb0 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: fffffbfff27a900cR10: ffffffff93d48067 R11: ffffffff8ae000eb R12: ffff88807b077800R13: dffffc0000000000 R14: ffff88807b077e40 R15: 0000000000000001FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff8880b9500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 0000564f4fc1e3a8 CR3: 000000000d57a000 CR4: 00000000003506f0DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400Call Trace: <NMI> </NMI> <TASK> unix_gc+0x563/0x13b0 net/unix/garbage.c:319 unix_release_sock+0xa93/0xf80 net/unix/af_unix.c:683 unix_release+0x91/0xf0 net/unix/af_unix.c:1064 __sock_release+0xb0/0x270 net/socket.c:659 sock_close+0x1c/0x30 net/socket.c:1421 __fput+0x270/0xb80 fs/file_table.c:376 task_work_run+0x14f/0x250 kernel/task_work.c:180 exit_task_work include/linux/task_work.h:38 [inline] do_exit+0xa8a/0x2ad0 kernel/exit.c:871 do_group_exit+0xd4/0x2a0 kernel/exit.c:1020 __do_sys_exit_group kernel/exit.c:1031 [inline] __se_sys_exit_group kernel/exit.c:1029 [inline] __x64_sys_exit_group+0x3e/0x50 kernel/exit.c:1029 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xd5/0x270 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6f/0x77RIP: 0033:0x7f9d6cbdac09Code: Unable to access opcode bytes at 0x7f9d6cbdabdf.RSP: 002b:00007fff5952feb8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000e7RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 00007f9d6cbdac09RDX: 000000000000003c RSI: 00000000000000e7 RDI: 0000000000000000RBP: 00007f9d6cc552b0 R08: ffffffffffffffb8 R09: 0000000000000006R10: 0000000000000006 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007f9d6cc552b0R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00007f9d6cc55d00 R15: 00007f9d6cbabe70 </TASK>",2024-04-04T14:15:09.667,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26780
CVE-2024-26792,NA,Google,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix double free of anonymous device after snapshot creation failureWhen creating a snapshot we may do a double free of an anonymous devicein case there's an error committing the transaction. The second free mayresult in freeing an anonymous device number that was allocated by someother subsystem in the kernel or another btrfs filesystem.The steps that lead to this:1) At ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we allocate an anonymous device number   and assign it to pending_snapshot->anon_dev;2) Then we call btrfs_commit_transaction() and end up at   transaction.c:create_pending_snapshot();3) There we call btrfs_get_new_fs_root() and pass it the anonymous device   number stored in pending_snapshot->anon_dev;4) btrfs_get_new_fs_root() frees that anonymous device number because   btrfs_lookup_fs_root() returned a root - someone else did a lookup   of the new root already, which could some task doing backref walking;5) After that some error happens in the transaction commit path, and at   ioctl.c:create_snapshot() we jump to the 'fail' label, and after   that we free again the same anonymous device number, which in the   meanwhile may have been reallocated somewhere else, because   pending_snapshot->anon_dev still has the same value as in step 1.Recently syzbot ran into this and reported the following trace:  ------------[ cut here ]------------  ida_free called for id=51 which is not allocated.

CVE-2024-31218,5.9,Phishing,"Webhood is a self-hosted URL scanner used analyzing phishing and malicious sites. Webhood's backend container images in versions 0.9.0 and earlier are subject to Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a HTTP request to the database (Pocketbase) admin API to create an admin account. The Pocketbase admin API does not check for authentication/authorization when creating an admin account when no admin accounts have been added. In its default deployment, Webhood does not create a database admin account. Therefore, unless users have manually created an admin account in the database, an admin account will not exist in the deployment and the deployment is vulnerable. Versions starting from 0.9.1 are patched. The patch creates a randomly generated admin account if admin accounts have not already been created i.e. the vulnerability is exploitable in the deployment. As a workaround, users can disable access to URL path starting with `/api/admins` entirely. With this workaround, the vulnerability is not exploitable via network.",2024-04-08T18:49:25.863,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-31218

[0]When ioctl(SIOCGARP) is issued, arp_req_get() looks up an neighbourentry and copies neigh->ha to struct arpreq.arp_ha.sa_data.The arp_ha here is struct sockaddr, not struct sockaddr_storage, sothe sa_data buffer is just 14 bytes.In the splat below, 2 bytes are overflown to the next int field,arp_flags.  We initialise the field just after the memcpy(), so it'snot a problem.However, when dev->addr_len is greater than 22 (e.g. MAX_ADDR_LEN),arp_netmask is overwritten, which could be set as htonl(0xFFFFFFFFUL)in arp_ioctl() before calling arp_req_get().To avoid the overflow, let's limit the max length of memcpy().Note that commit b5f0de6df6dc (""net: dev: Convert sa_data to flexiblearray in struct sockaddr"") just silenced syzkaller.[0]:memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 16) of single field ""r->arp_ha.sa_data"" at net/ipv4/arp.c:1128 (size 14)WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 144638 at net/ipv4/arp.c:1128 arp_req_get+0x411/0x4a0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1128Modules linked in:CPU: 0 PID: 144638 Comm: syz-executor.4 Not tainted 6.1.74 #31Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.0-debian-1.16.0-5 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:arp_req_get+0x411/0x4a0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1128Code: fd ff ff e8 41 42 de fb b9 0e 00 00 00 4c 89 fe 48 c7 c2 20 6d ab 87 48 c7 c7 80 6d ab 87 c6 05 25 af 72 04 01 e8 5f 8d ad fb <0f> 0b e9 6c fd ff ff e8 13 42 de fb be 03 00 00 00 4c 89 e7 e8 a6RSP: 0018:ffffc900050b7998 EFLAGS: 00010286RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff88803a815000 RCX: 0000000000000000RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffffff8641a44a RDI: 0000000000000001RBP: ffffc900050b7a98 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 203a7970636d656d R12: ffff888039c54000R13: 1ffff92000a16f37 R14: ffff88803a815084 R15: 0000000000000010FS:  00007f172bf306c0(0000) GS:ffff88805aa00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00007f172b3569f0 CR3: 0000000057f12005 CR4: 0000000000770ef0DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: <TASK> arp_ioctl+0x33f/0x4b0 net/ipv4/arp.c:1261 inet_ioctl+0x314/0x3a0 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:981 sock_do_ioctl+0xdf/0x260 net/socket.c:1204 sock_ioctl+0x3ef/0x650 net/socket.c:1321 vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline] __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:870 [inline] __se_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:856 [inline] __x64_sys_ioctl+0x18e/0x220 fs/ioctl.c:856 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:51 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x37/0x90 arch/x86/entry/common.c:81 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x64/0xceRIP: 0033:0x7f172b262b8dCode: 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 00 f3 0f 1e fa 48 89 f8 48 89 f7 48 89 d6 48 89 ca 4d 89 c2 4d 89 c8 4c 8b 4c 24 08 0f 05 <48> 3d 01 f0 ff ff 73 01 c3 48 c7 c1 b8 ff ff ff f7 d8 64 89 01 48RSP: 002b:00007f172bf300b8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000010RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00007f172b3abf80 RCX: 00007f172b262b8dRDX: 0000000020000000 RSI: 0000000000008954 RDI: 0000000000000003RBP: 00007f172b2d3493 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 0000000000000000R13: 000000000000000b R14: 00007f172b3abf80 R15: 00007f172bf10000 </TASK>",2024-04-03T17:24:18.150,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26733

CVE-2024-26687,NA,Xen,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanupshutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking theirq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Bothare called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.This opens multiple races:- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event  channel:  CPU0                        CPU1  shutdown_pirq {    xen_evtchn_close(e)                              __startup_pirq {                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)                              }    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)    }  }  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel  number.  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.The fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the eventchannel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it'spotential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the eventchannel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMedevices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irqis called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race duringboot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq andstartup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.  ------------[ cut here ]------------  blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush: disabled; persistent grants: enabled; indirect descriptors: enabled; bounce buffer: enabled  kernel BUG at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:499!  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI  CPU: 44 PID: 375 Comm: kworker/u257:23 Not tainted 5.10.201-191.748.amzn2.x86_64 #1  Hardware name: Xen HVM domU, BIOS 4.11.amazon 08/24/2006  Workqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work  RIP: 0010:bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0  Code: 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc 44 89 f7 e8 2b 55 ad ff 49 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 64 ff ff ff 4c 8b 68 30 41 83 fe ff 0f 85 60 ff ff ff <0f> 0b 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 0f 1f 44 00 00  RSP: 0000:ffffc9000d533b08 EFLAGS: 00010046  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000006  RDX: 0000000000000028 RSI: 00000000ffffffff RDI: 00000000ffffffff  RBP: ffff888107419680 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffffff82d72b00  R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 00000000000001ed  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00000000ffffffff R15: 0000000000000002  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88bc8b500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000002610001 CR4: 00000000001706e0  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400  Call Trace:   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? set_affinity_irq+0xdc/0x1c0   ? __die_body.cold+0x8/0xd   ? die+0x2b/0x50   ? do_trap+0x90/0x110   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x12/0x20   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0x---truncated---",2024-04-03T17:24:18.150,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26687

CVE-2024-26678,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat sectionThe .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address ofthe 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from32-bit firmware (i.e., CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from theloader, and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image,to avoid the need for padding it to 4k, which is required for sectionsappearing in the middle of the image.Unfortunately, this violates the PE/COFF spec, and even if most EFIloaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore referenceimplementation), PE loaders do exist that reject such images, on thebasis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should bedescribed by the section headers in a monotonically increasing mannerwithout leaving any gaps.So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slightpadding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disablingCONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days)",2024-04-04T14:15:09.513,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26678
