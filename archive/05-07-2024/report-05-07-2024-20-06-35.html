      <td>Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories</td>

On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affected mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only.

      <td>The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Then, we shouldrather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of theGT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref longenough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is releasedand the GT parked.I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 ("drm/i915:Remove the vma refcount") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() froma dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by abug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9("drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation").A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's activeintel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on thatintel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as theVMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goesidle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, useasync variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),    - using async variant of _put(),    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm-&gt;mutex.v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().v5: Replace "tile" with "GT" across commit description (Rodrigo),  - ---truncated---</td>

This vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, or by a user who has not been granted edit access to the model in question. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets are also unaffected. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.3 and 6.1. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected. Users are advised to upgrade. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched version can avoid the vulnerability as follows: 1.For models registered through `ModelViewSet`, register the model as a snippet instead; 2. For settings models, place the restricted fields in a separate settings model, and configure permission at the model level.</td>

When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink, the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl, also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.This feature is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.</td>

Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter, it was possible to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path.                                         This means that if the datasource was configured by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ ), it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues queries containing path traversal characters, which would in turn cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/) https://example.com/api/admin_api/) .In the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana instance itself, this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe, as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials, resulting in the potential for privilege escalation, hence the high score for this vulnerability.</td>

      <td>Phlex is a framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. In affected versions there is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. Since the last two vulnerabilities https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g and https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c, we have invested in extensive browser tests. It was these new tests that helped us uncover these issues. As of now the project exercises every possible attack vector the developers can think of — including enumerating every ASCII character, and we run these tests in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Additionally, we test against a list of 6613 known XSS payloads (see: payloadbox/xss-payload-list). The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account just how recklessly permissive browsers are when it comes to executing unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes. If you render an `&lt;a&gt;` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for all minor versions released in the last year. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should configure a Content Security Policy that does not allow `unsafe-inline` which would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. Users who upgrade are also advised to configure a Content Security Policy header that does not allow `unsafe-inline`.</td>

When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to "Cluster" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren't known to be exposed.2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2.3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.

      <td>A medium severity vulnerability has been identified in the update mechanism of the Phish Alert Button for Outlook, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the host machine. The vulnerability arises from the application's failure to securely verify the authenticity and integrity of the update server.The application periodically checks for updates by querying a specific URL. However, this process does not enforce strict SSL/TLS verification, nor does it validate the digital signature of the received update files. An attacker with the capability to perform DNS spoofing can exploit this weakness. By manipulating DNS responses, the attacker can redirect the application's update requests to a malicious server under their control.Once the application queries the spoofed update URL, the malicious server can respond with a crafted update package. Since the application fails to properly verify the authenticity of the update file, it will accept and execute the package, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host machine.Impact:Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code with elevated privileges, potentially leading to data theft, installation of further malware, or other malicious activities on the host system.Affected Products:Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook versions 1.10.0-1.10.11Second Chance Client versions 2.0.0-2.0.9PIQ Client versions 1.0.0-1.0.15Remediation:Automated updates will be pushed to address this issue. Users of affected versions should verify the latest version is applied and, if not, apply the latest updates provided by KnowBe4, which addresses this vulnerability by implementing proper SSL/TLS checks of the update server. It is also recommended to ensure DNS settings are secure to prevent DNS spoofing attacks.Workarounds:Use secure corporate networks or VPN services to secure network communications, which can help mitigate the risk of DNS spoofing.Credits:This vulnerability was discovered by Ceri Coburn at Pen Test Partners, who reported it responsibly to the vendor.</td>

      <td>A local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been identified in Phish Alert Button for Outlook (PAB), specifically within its configuration management functionalities. This vulnerability allows a regular user to modify the application's configuration file to redirect update checks to an arbitrary server, which can then be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2024-29209 to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.The issue stems from improper permission settings on the application's configuration file, which is stored in a common directory accessible to all users. This file includes critical parameters, such as the update server URL. By default, the application does not enforce adequate access controls on this file, allowing non-privileged users to modify it without administrative consent.An attacker with regular user access can alter the update server URL specified in the configuration file to point to a malicious server. When the application performs its next update check, it will contact the attacker-controlled server. If the system is also vulnerable to CVE-2024-29209, the attacker can deliver a malicious update package that, when executed, grants them elevated privileges.Impact:This vulnerability can lead to a regular user executing code with administrative privileges. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, installation of additional malware, and a full takeover of the affected system.Affected Products:Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook versions 1.10.0-1.10.11Second Chance Client versions 2.0.0-2.0.9PIQ Client versions 1.0.0-1.0.15Remediation:KnowBe4 has released a patch that corrects the permission settings on the configuration file to prevent unauthorized modifications.

An application calling any of those otherfunctions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by thisare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the"-pubcheck" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.</td>

Thus the contents of some of these vector registersare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies thatTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. Howeverwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affectedby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.</td>

Where the key thatis being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may leadto a Denial of Service.When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and thiscomputation completes quickly.

And that in turn fixes the moduleunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU referenceuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts thelast reference to the KVM module.Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item offthe completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as thework will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waitingon the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for thework to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a verysmall delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes anew request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so theremaining work is really just:        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);        mmput(mm);and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU isstill alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with "wakeup all"work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in aworkqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).Note, commit 5f6de5cbebee ("KVM: Prevent module exit until al---truncated---</td>

      <td>Apollo Router is a configurable, graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. The affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that in limited circumstances, could lead to unexpected operations being executed which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. The root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router’s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors. The issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary. For a query, results may be fetched that don’t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`. For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`. Users who are using distributed query plan caching, are advised to either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 are not recommended for use and have been withdrawn. Users unable to upgrade can disable distributed query plan caching to mitigate this issue.</td>

      <td>SSH</td>
      <td>In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.</td>

      <td>libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>

      <td>Windows</td>
      <td>Rust is a programming language. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.The `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.On Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.One exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an `InvalidInput` error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.The fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.</td>

So it doesn't make sense to free memoryback to memblock. memblock_free() called by xbc_exit() even causes UAF bugson architectures with CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK disabled like x86.Following KASAN logs shows this case.This patch fixes the xbc memory free problem by calling memblock_free()in early xbc init error rewind path and calling memblock_free_late() inxbc exit path to free memory to buddy allocator.[    9.410890] ==================================================================[    9.418962] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in memblock_isolate_range+0x12d/0x260[    9.426850] Read of size 8 at addr ffff88845dd30000 by task swapper/0/1[    9.435901] CPU: 9 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Tainted: G     U             6.9.0-rc3-00208-g586b5dfb51b9 #5[    9.446403] Hardware name: Intel Corporation RPLP LP5 (CPU:RaptorLake)/RPLP LP5 (ID:13), BIOS IRPPN02.01.01.00.00.19.015.D-00000000 Dec 28 2023[    9.460789] Call Trace:[    9.463518]  &lt;TASK&gt;[    9.465859]  dump_stack_lvl+0x53/0x70[    9.469949]  print_report+0xce/0x610[    9.473944]  ? __virt_addr_valid+0xf5/0x1b0[    9.478619]  ? memblock_isolate_range+0x12d/0x260[    9.483877]  kasan_report+0xc6/0x100[    9.487870]  ? memblock_isolate_range+0x12d/0x260[    9.493125]  memblock_isolate_range+0x12d/0x260[    9.498187]  memblock_phys_free+0xb4/0x160[    9.502762]  ? __pfx_memblock_phys_free+0x10/0x10[    9.508021]  ? mutex_unlock+0x7e/0xd0[    9.512111]  ? __pfx_mutex_unlock+0x10/0x10[    9.516786]  ? kernel_init_freeable+0x2d4/0x430[    9.521850]  ? __pfx_kernel_init+0x10/0x10[    9.526426]  xbc_exit+0x17/0x70[    9.529935]  kernel_init+0x38/0x1e0[    9.533829]  ? _raw_spin_unlock_irq+0xd/0x30[    9.538601]  ret_from_fork+0x2c/0x50[    9.542596]  ? __pfx_kernel_init+0x10/0x10[    9.547170]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30[    9.551552]  &lt;/TASK&gt;[    9.555649] The buggy address belongs to the physical page:[    9.561875] page: refcount:0 mapcount:0 mapping:0000000000000000 index:0x1 pfn:0x45dd30[    9.570821] flags: 0x200000000000000(node=0|zone=2)[    9.576271] page_type: 0xffffffff()[    9.580167] raw: 0200000000000000 ffffea0011774c48 ffffea0012ba1848 0000000000000000[    9.588823] raw: 0000000000000001 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000[    9.597476] page dumped because: kasan: bad access detected[    9.605362] Memory state around the buggy address:[    9.610714]  ffff88845dd2ff00: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[    9.618786]  ffff88845dd2ff80: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[    9.626857] &gt;ffff88845dd30000: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff[    9.634930]                    ^[    9.638534]  ffff88845dd30080: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff[    9.646605]  ffff88845dd30100: ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff[    9.654675] ==================================================================</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86/mmu: x86: Don't overflow lpage_info when checking attributesFix KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES to not overflow lpage_info array and triggerKASAN splat, as seen in the private_mem_conversions_test selftest.When memory attributes are set on a GFN range, that range will havespecific properties applied to the TDP. A huge page cannot be used whenthe attributes are inconsistent, so they are disabled for those thespecific huge pages. For internal KVM reasons, huge pages are also notallowed to span adjacent memslots regardless of whether the backing memorycould be mapped as huge.What GFNs support which huge page sizes is tracked by an array of arrays'lpage_info' on the memslot, of ‘kvm_lpage_info’ structs. Each index oflpage_info contains a vmalloc allocated array of these for a specificsupported page size. The kvm_lpage_info denotes whether a specific hugepage (GFN and page size) on the memslot is supported. These arrays includeindices for unaligned head and tail huge pages.Preventing huge pages from spanning adjacent memslot is covered byincrementing the count in head and tail kvm_lpage_info when the memslot isallocated, but disallowing huge pages for memory that has mixed attributeshas to be done in a more complicated way. During theKVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES ioctl KVM updates lpage_info for each memslot inthe range that has mismatched attributes. KVM does this a memslot at atime, and marks a special bit, KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG, in the kvm_lpage_infofor any huge page. This bit is essentially a permanently elevated count.So huge pages will not be mapped for the GFN at that page size if thecount is elevated in either case: a huge head or tail page unaligned tothe memslot or if KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is set because it has mixedattributes.To determine whether a huge page has consistent attributes, theKVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES operation checks an xarray to make sure itconsistently has the incoming attribute. Since level - 1 huge pages arealigned to level huge pages, it employs an optimization. As long as thelevel - 1 huge pages are checked first, it can just check these and assumethat if each level - 1 huge page contained within the level sized hugepage is not mixed, then the level size huge page is not mixed. Thisoptimization happens in the helper hugepage_has_attrs().Unfortunately, although the kvm_lpage_info array representing page size'level' will contain an entry for an unaligned tail page of size level,the array for level - 1  will not contain an entry for each GFN at pagesize level. The level - 1 array will only contain an index for anyunaligned region covered by level - 1 huge page size, which can be asmaller region. So this causes the optimization to overflow the level - 1kvm_lpage_info and perform a vmalloc out of bounds read.In some cases of head and tail pages where an overflow could happen,callers skip the operation completely as KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is notrequired to prevent huge pages as discussed earlier. But for memslots thatare smaller than the 1GB page size, it does call hugepage_has_attrs(). Inthis case the huge page is both the head and tail page. The issue can beobserved simply by compiling the kernel with CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC andrunning the selftest “private_mem_conversions_test”, which produces theoutput like the following:BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in hugepage_has_attrs+0x7e/0x110Read of size 4 at addr ffffc900000a3008 by task private_mem_con/169Call Trace:  dump_stack_lvl  print_report  ? __virt_addr_valid  ? hugepage_has_attrs  ? hugepage_has_attrs  kasan_report  ? hugepage_has_attrs  hugepage_has_attrs  kvm_arch_post_set_memory_attributes  kvm_vm_ioctlIt is a little ambiguous whether the unaligned head page (in the bug casealso the tail page) should be expected to have KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG set.It is not functionally required, as the unal---truncated---</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86/pmu: Disable support for adaptive PEBSDrop support for virtualizing adaptive PEBS, as KVM's implementation isarchitecturally broken without an obvious/easy path forward, and becauseexposing adaptive PEBS can leak host LBRs to the guest, i.e. can leakhost kernel addresses to the guest.Bug #1 is that KVM doesn't account for the upper 32 bits ofIA32_FIXED_CTR_CTRL when (re)programming fixed counters, e.gfixed_ctrl_field() drops the upper bits, reprogram_fixed_counters()stores local variables as u8s and truncates the upper bits too, etc.Bug #2 is that, because KVM _always_ sets precise_ip to a non-zero valuefor PEBS events, perf will _always_ generate an adaptive record, even ifthe guest requested a basic record.  Note, KVM will also enable adaptivePEBS in individual *counter*, even if adaptive PEBS isn't exposed to theguest, but this is benign as MSR_PEBS_DATA_CFG is guaranteed to be zero,i.e. the guest will only ever see Basic records.Bug #3 is in perf.  intel_pmu_disable_fixed() doesn't clear the upperbits either, i.e. leaves ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVE set, andintel_pmu_enable_fixed() effectively doesn't clear ICL_FIXED_0_ADAPTIVEeither.  I.e. perf _always_ enables ADAPTIVE counters, regardless of whatKVM requests.Bug #4 is that adaptive PEBS *might* effectively bypass event filters setby the host, as "Updated Memory Access Info Group" records informationthat might be disallowed by userspace via KVM_SET_PMU_EVENT_FILTER.Bug #5 is that KVM doesn't ensure LBR MSRs hold guest values (or at leastzeros) when entering a vCPU with adaptive PEBS, which allows the guestto read host LBRs, i.e. host RIPs/addresses, by enabling "LBR Entries"records.Disable adaptive PEBS support as an immediate fix due to the severity ofthe LBR leak in particular, and because fixing all of the bugs will benon-trivial, e.g. not suitable for backporting to stable kernels.Note!  This will break live migration, but trying to make KVM play nicewith live migration would be quite complicated, wouldn't be guaranteed towork (i.e. KVM might still kill/confuse the guest), and it's not clearthat there are any publicly available VMMs that support adaptive PEBS,let alone live migrate VMs that support adaptive PEBS, e.g. QEMU doesn'tsupport PEBS in any capacity.</td>
