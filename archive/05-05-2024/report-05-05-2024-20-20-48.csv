CVE-2023-46288,1.4,Airflow,"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.4.0 to 2.7.0.Sensitive configuration information has been exposed to authenticated users with the ability to read configuration via Airflow REST API for configuration even when the expose_config option is set to non-sensitive-only. The expose_config option is False by default. It is recommended to upgrade to a version that is not affected if you set expose_config to non-sensitive-only configuration. This is a different error than CVE-2023-45348 which allows authenticated user to retrieve individual configuration values in 2.7.* by specially crafting their request (solved in 2.7.2).Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.2, which fixes the issue and additionally fixes CVE-2023-45348.",2024-05-01T18:15:10.563,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-46288

CVE-2024-29735,NA,Airflow,"Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories",2024-05-01T19:15:23.573,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-29735

CVE-2021-31618,3.6,Apache,"Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affected mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only.

CVE-2023-48795,3.6,Apache,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

CVE-2022-48644,NA,Atom,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: taprio: avoid disabling offload when it was never enabledIn an incredibly strange API design decision, qdisc->destroy() getscalled even if qdisc->init() never succeeded, not exclusively sincecommit 87b60cfacf9f (""net_sched: fix error recovery at qdisc creation""),but apparently also earlier (in the case of qdisc_create_dflt()).The taprio qdisc does not fully acknowledge this when it attempts fulloffload, because it starts off with q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID intaprio_init(), then it replaces q->flags with TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_FLAGSparsed from netlink (in taprio_change(), tail called from taprio_init()).But in taprio_destroy(), we call taprio_disable_offload(), and thisdetermines what to do based on FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED(q->flags).But looking at the implementation of FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED()(a bitwise check of bit 1 in q->flags), it is invalid to call this macroon q->flags when it contains TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, because that is setto U32_MAX, and therefore FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED() will return true onan invalid set of flags.As a result, it is possible to crash the kernel if user space forces anerror between setting q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, and the callingof taprio_enable_offload().

Then, we shouldrather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of theGT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref longenough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is releasedand the GT parked.I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() froma dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by abug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's activeintel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on thatintel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as theVMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goesidle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, useasync variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),    - using async variant of _put(),    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().v5: Replace ""tile"" with ""GT"" across commit description (Rodrigo),  - ---truncated---",2024-05-01T13:02:20.750,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26939

In this case, the fix isto move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver toafter all resources have been looked up.Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registerschild devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issuein driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (seecommit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).[DB: slightly fixed commit message by adding the word 'commit']",2024-04-29T19:45:21.680,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26909

The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies thatTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. Howeverwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affectedby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.",2024-05-03T13:15:21.163,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-6129
CVE-2024-0727,3.6,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSLto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attackImpact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrustedsources might terminate abruptly.A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from anuntrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, butOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointerdereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application willbe vulnerable to this issue.OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()and PKCS12_newpass().We have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since thisfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.",2024-05-01T18:15:13.057,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-0727
CVE-2024-2511,NA,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unboundedmemory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessionsImpact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to triggerunbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of ServiceThis problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option isbeing used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the defaultanti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, thesession cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properlyas it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. Amalicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure toforce a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation.This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLSclients.The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

CVE-2023-6237,NA,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may takea long time.Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key thatis being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may leadto a Denial of Service.When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and thiscomputation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime,then this computation would take a long time.An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA keyobtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Serviceattack.The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSLfunctions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command lineapplication.

CVE-2024-32971,6.0,Redis,"Apollo Router is a configurable, graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. The affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that in limited circumstances, could lead to unexpected operations being executed which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. The root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router’s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors. The issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary. For a query, results may be fetched that don’t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`. For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`. Users who are using distributed query plan caching, are advised to either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 are not recommended for use and have been withdrawn. Users unable to upgrade can disable distributed query plan caching to mitigate this issue.",2024-05-02T13:27:25.103,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-32971

CVE-2024-24806,3.4,Windows,"libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",2024-05-01T18:15:14.987,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-24806
CVE-2024-24576,6.0,Windows,"Rust is a programming language. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.The `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.On Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.One exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an `InvalidInput` error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.The fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.
