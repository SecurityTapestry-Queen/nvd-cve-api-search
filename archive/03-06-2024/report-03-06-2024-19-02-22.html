Upgrade bRPC to version 1.8.0, which fixes this issue. Download link:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/releases/tag/1.8.0 2. Apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2518</td>

      <td>mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified™ authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</td>

For instance, if a sessionhas refcount == 1, and one thread tries to free this session via:    kref_put(&amp;sess-&gt;refcount, destroy_session);the reference count will get decremented, and the next step would be tocall destroy_session(). However, if in another thread,amdtee_open_session() is called before destroy_session() has completedexecution, alloc_session() may return 'sess' that will be freed uplater in destroy_session() leading to use-after-free inamdtee_open_session.To fix this issue, treat decrement of sess-&gt;refcount and removal of'sess' from session list in destroy_session() as a critical section, sothat it is executed atomically.</td>

      <td>Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into its dependency cache, it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates, Gradle can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may be written outside the dependency cache or over another file in the dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the filesystem where the Gradle process has write permissions. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have control over a dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the ability to modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will refuse to cache dependencies that have path traversal elements in their dependency coordinates. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If you are unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2, `dependency verification` will make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit.</td>

      <td>Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. In affected versions when unpacking Tar archives, Gradle did not check that files could be written outside of the unpack location. This could lead to important files being overwritten anywhere the Gradle process has write permissions. For a build reading Tar entries from a Tar archive, this issue could allow Gradle to disclose information from sensitive files through an arbitrary file read. To exploit this behavior, an attacker needs to either control the source of an archive already used by the build or modify the build to interact with a malicious archive. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Starting from these versions, Gradle will refuse to handle Tar archives which contain path traversal elements in a Tar entry name. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.### ImpactThis is a path traversal vulnerability when Gradle deals with Tar archives, often referenced as TarSlip, a variant of ZipSlip.* When unpacking Tar archives, Gradle did not check that files could be written outside of the unpack location. This could lead to important files being overwritten anywhere the Gradle process has write permissions.* For a build reading Tar entries from a Tar archive, this issue could allow Gradle to disclose information from sensitive files through an arbitrary file read.To exploit this behavior, an attacker needs to either control the source of an archive already used by the build or modify the build to interact with a malicious archive. It is unlikely that this would go unnoticed.Gradle uses Tar archives for its [Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html). These archives are safe when created by Gradle. But if an attacker had control of a remote build cache server, they could inject malicious build cache entries that leverage this vulnerability. This attack vector could also be exploited if a man-in-the-middle can be performed between the remote cache and the build.### PatchesA fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Starting from these versions, Gradle will refuse to handle Tar archives which contain path traversal elements in a Tar entry name.It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version.### WorkaroundsThere is no workaround.* If your build deals with Tar archives that you do not fully trust, you need to inspect them to confirm they do not attempt to leverage this vulnerability.* If you use the Gradle remote build cache, make sure only trusted parties have write access to it and that connections to the remote cache are properly secured.### References* [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)* [Gradle Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html)* [ZipSlip](https://security.snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability)</td>

Combined with an Out Of Band XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to exfiltration of local text files to a remote server. Gradle parses XML files for several purposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files it generated or were already present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors and Maven POM files can be fetched from remote repositories and parsed by Gradle. In Gradle 7.6.3 and 8.4, resolving XML external entities has been disabled for all use cases to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will now refuse to parse XML files that have XML external entities.</td>

      <td>The implementation of PEAP in wpa_supplicant through 2.10 allows authentication bypass. For a successful attack, wpa_supplicant must be configured to not verify the network's TLS certificate during Phase 1 authentication, and an eap_peap_decrypt vulnerability can then be abused to skip Phase 2 authentication. The attack vector is sending an EAP-TLV Success packet instead of starting Phase 2. This allows an adversary to impersonate Enterprise Wi-Fi networks.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnecthidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)races when it races with itself.hidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runson probe() and if a "device-connected" packet is received by the hwwhen the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting onthe hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will bestarted from the workqueue.This opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):\tif (!hidpp-&gt;protocol_major) {\t\thidpp_root_get_protocol_version()\t\thidpp-&gt;protocol_major = response.rap.params[0];\t}We can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt outputattached to rhbz#2227968:[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.Testing with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threadstake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pongthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):\tif (hidpp-&gt;name == hdev-&gt;name) {\t\t...\t\thidpp-&gt;name = new_name;\t}3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):hidpp_initialize_battery(){        if (hidpp-&gt;battery.ps)                return 0;\tprobe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */\thidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties =\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\thidpp-&gt;battery.ps =\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&amp;hidpp-&gt;hid_dev-&gt;dev,\t\t\t\t\t   &amp;hidpp-&gt;battery.desc, cfg);}4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):\tif (hidpp-&gt;delayed_input)\t\treturn;\thidpp-&gt;delayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);The really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the followingsequence:\thidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties =\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\thidpp-&gt;battery.ps =\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&amp;hidpp-&gt;hid_dev-&gt;dev,\t\t\t\t\t   &amp;hidpp-&gt;battery.desc, cfg);\t...\thidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties =\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\thidpp-&gt;battery.ps =\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&amp;hidpp-&gt;hid_dev-&gt;dev,\t\t\t\t\t   &amp;hidpp-&gt;battery.desc, cfg);So now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,which looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not eventhe really big problem.Notice how:1. This is all devm-maganaged2. The hidpp-&gt;battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies3. hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second   devm_kmemdup()This causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,   hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp-&gt;battery.desc.properties which   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08...Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_eventSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0...Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ---truncated---</td>

After memblock_init(),those late calls of memblock_reserve() operate on subregions of memblock.memory regions. As a result, these reserved regions will be set to thecorrect node at the first iteration of memmap_init_reserved_pages().So set all reserved memblocks on Node#0 at initialization can avoid thispanic.</td>

      <td>MyBB is a free and open source forum software. Custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor (_SCEditor_) doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. The impact is be mitigated when: 1. the visual editor is disabled globally (_Admin CP → Configuration → Settings → Clickable Smilies and BB Code: [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_ is set to _Off_), or 2. the visual editor is disabled for individual user accounts (_User CP → Your Profile → Edit Options_: _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_ checkbox is not checked). MyBB 1.8.37 resolves this issue with the commit `6dcaf0b4d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the impact without upgrading MyBB by changing the following setting (_Admin CP → Configuration → Settings_):- _Clickable Smilies and BB Code → [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_: _Off_.

But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +fx_sw-&gt;xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back andtries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever.Instead, fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (takenfrom fpstate-&gt;user_size).[ dhansen: tweak subject / changelog ]</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompressionCurrently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplacedecompression, that was used to handle the cases that some pages ofcompressed data are actually not in-place I/O.However, like most simple LZ77 algorithms, LZ4 expects the compresseddata is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and itexplicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:  __________________________________________________________ |_ direction of decompression --&gt; ____ |_ compressed data _|Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this, it typically maps twoindividual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain.Previously, it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() forshort overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem tocompletely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reportedthat EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor.After some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors with the newFSRM feature expose this issue with "rep movsb".Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplacedecompression for now.  Later, as an useful improvement, we could tryto tie up these two buffers together in the correct order.</td>
