CVE-2021-47552,NA,Dell,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:blk-mq: cancel blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue and disk_release()For avoiding to slow down queue destroy, we don't callblk_mq_quiesce_queue() in blk_cleanup_queue(), instead of delaying tocancel dispatch work in blk_release_queue().However, this way has caused kernel oops[1], reported by Changhui. The logshows that scsi_device can be freed before running blk_release_queue(),which is expected too since scsi_device is released after the scsi diskis closed and the scsi_device is removed.Fixes the issue by canceling blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue()and disk_release():1) when disk_release() is run, the disk has been closed, and any syncdispatch activities have been done, so canceling dispatch work is enough toquiesce filesystem I/O dispatch activity.2) in blk_cleanup_queue(), we only focus on passthrough request, andpassthrough request is always explicitly allocated & freed byits caller, so once queue is frozen, all sync dispatch activityfor passthrough request has been done, then it is enough to just canceldispatch work for avoiding any dispatch activity.[1] kernel panic log[12622.769416] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000300[12622.777186] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode[12622.782918] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page[12622.788649] PGD 0 P4D 0[12622.791474] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI[12622.796138] CPU: 10 PID: 744 Comm: kworker/10:1H Kdump: loaded Not tainted 5.15.0+ #1[12622.804877] Hardware name: Dell Inc.

CVE-2021-47546,NA,Firewall,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv6: fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppressThe kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftablesfirewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routingrules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such scenarios, everyincoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I trackeddown the issue to ca7a03c41753 (""ipv6: do not free rt ifFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule"").The problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` notdecreasing the refcount when needed.How to reproduce: - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop   This can be done with:     sudo nft create table inet test     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop - Run:     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0 - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase   with every incoming ipv6 packet.This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocolspecific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the genericFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.[1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L71[2]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L99",2024-05-24T18:09:20.027,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47546

CVE-2024-35238,3.6,GitHub,"Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. Minder prior to version 0.0.51 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack which could allow an attacker to crash the Minder server and deny other users access to it. The root cause of the vulnerability is that Minders sigstore verifier reads an untrusted response entirely into memory without enforcing a limit on the response body. An attacker can exploit this by making Minder make a request to an attacker-controlled endpoint which returns a response with a large body which will crash the Minder server. Specifically, the point of failure is where Minder parses the response from the GitHub attestations endpoint in `getAttestationReply`. Here, Minder makes a request to the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint (line 285) and then parses the response into the `AttestationReply` (line 295). The way Minder parses the response on line 295 makes it prone to DoS if the response is large enough. Essentially, the response needs to be larger than the machine has available memory.  Version 0.0.51 contains a patch for this issue.The content that is hosted at the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub attestation endpoint is controlled by users including unauthenticated users to Minders threat model. However, a user will need to configure their own Minder settings to cause Minder to make Minder send a request to fetch the attestations. The user would need to know of a package whose attestations were configured in such a way that they would return a large response when fetching them. As such, the steps needed to carry out this attack would look as such:1. The attacker adds a package to ghcr.io with attestations that can be fetched via the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint.2. The attacker registers on Minder and makes Minder fetch the attestations.3. Minder fetches attestations and crashes thereby being denied of service.",2024-05-28T12:39:28.377,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35238

CVE-2024-36114,4.7,JDK,"Aircompressor is a library with ports of the Snappy, LZO, LZ4, and Zstandard compression algorithms to Java. All decompressor implementations of Aircompressor (LZ4, LZO, Snappy, Zstandard) can crash the JVM for certain input, and in some cases also leak the content of other memory of the Java process (which could contain sensitive information). When decompressing certain data, the decompressors try to access memory outside the bounds of the given byte arrays or byte buffers. Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed. When decompressing data from untrusted users, this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM, or to leak other sensitive information from the Java process.

CVE-2024-35237,3.6,Node.js,"MIT IdentiBot is an open-source Discord bot written in Node.js that verifies individuals' affiliations with MIT, grants them roles in a Discord server, and stores information about them in a database backend. A vulnerability that exists prior to commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e impacts all users who have performed verification with an instance of MIT IdentiBot that meets the following conditions: The instance of IdentiBot is tied to a ""public"" Discord application—i.e., users other than the API access registrant can add it to servers; *and* the instance has not yet been patched. In affected versions, IdentiBot does not check that a server is authorized before allowing members to execute slash and user commands in that server. As a result, any user can join IdentiBot to their server and then use commands (e.g., `/kerbid`) to reveal the full name and other information about a Discord user who has verified their affiliation with MIT using IdentiBot. The latest version of MIT IdentiBot contains a patch for this vulnerability (implemented in commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e). There is no way to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability without the patch.

CVE-2024-36105,1.4,Python,"dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications. Prior to versions 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1, Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `""0.0.0.0""`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `""::""`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.",2024-05-28T12:39:28.377,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-36105

The latter takes place forexample when user changes queue count on an interface via ethtool'sset_channels().There is an issue around the bpf_prog refcounting when VSI is beingrebuilt - since ice_prepare_xdp_rings() is called with vsi->xdp_prog asan argument that is used later on by ice_vsi_assign_bpf_prog(), samebpf_prog pointers are swapped with each other.
