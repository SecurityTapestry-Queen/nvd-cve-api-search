CVE-2016-3094,3.6,Apache,"PlainSaslServer.java in Apache Qpid Java before 6.0.3, when the broker is configured to allow plaintext passwords, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (broker termination) via a crafted authentication attempt, which triggers an uncaught exception.",2023-05-22T15:46:39.577,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2016-3094
CVE-2016-8741,3.6,Apache,The Apache Qpid Broker for Java can be configured to use different so called AuthenticationProviders to handle user authentication. Among the choices are the SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 AuthenticationProvider types. It was discovered that these AuthenticationProviders in Apache Qpid Broker for Java 6.0.x before 6.0.6 and 6.1.x before 6.1.1 prematurely terminate the SCRAM SASL negotiation if the provided user name does not exist thus allowing remote attacker to determine the existence of user accounts. The Vulnerability does not apply to AuthenticationProviders other than SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256.,2023-05-22T15:46:50.753,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2016-8741
CVE-2017-15701,3.6,Apache,In Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.4 (inclusive) the broker does not properly enforce a maximum frame size in AMQP 1.0 frames. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate. Older AMQP protocols are not affected.,2023-05-22T15:46:42.590,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-15701
CVE-2017-15702,5.9,Apache,"In Apache Qpid Broker-J 0.18 through 0.32, if the broker is configured with different authentication providers on different ports one of which is an HTTP port, then the broker can be tricked by a remote unauthenticated attacker connecting to the HTTP port into using an authentication provider that was configured on a different port. The attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed port has weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented by this vulnerability. AMQP ports are not affected. Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected.",2023-05-22T15:46:45.633,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-15702
