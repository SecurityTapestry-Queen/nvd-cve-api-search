CVE-2024-4254,4.2,AWS,"The 'deploy-website.yml' workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically in the 'main' branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to improper authorization. The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN, AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.",2024-06-04T16:57:41.053,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-4254
CVE-2024-4084,4.0,AWS,"A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the latest version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing attackers to bypass the official fix intended to restrict access to intranet IP addresses and protocols. Despite efforts to filter out intranet IP addresses starting with 192, 172, 10, and 127 through regular expressions and limit access protocols to HTTP and HTTPS, attackers can still bypass these restrictions using alternative representations of IP addresses and accessing other ports running on localhost. This vulnerability enables attackers to access any asset on the internal network, attack web services on the internal network, scan hosts on the internal network, and potentially access AWS metadata endpoints. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, which can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.",2024-06-05T12:53:50.240,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-4084

CVE-2024-36937,NA,Atom,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xdp: use flags field to disambiguate broadcast redirectWhen redirecting a packet using XDP, the bpf_redirect_map() helper will setup the redirect destination information in struct bpf_redirect_info (usingthe __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() helper function), and the xdp_do_redirect()function will read this information after the XDP program returns and passthe frame on to the right redirect destination.When using the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag to do multicast redirect to a wholemap, __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() sets the 'map' pointer in structbpf_redirect_info to point to the destination map to be broadcast. Andxdp_do_redirect() reacts to the value of this map pointer to decide whetherit's dealing with a broadcast or a single-value redirect. However, if thedestination map is being destroyed before xdp_do_redirect() is called, themap pointer will be cleared out (by bpf_clear_redirect_map()) withoutwaiting for any XDP programs to stop running. This causes xdp_do_redirect()to think that the redirect was to a single target, but the target pointeris also NULL (since broadcast redirects don't have a single target), sothis causes a crash when a NULL pointer is passed to dev_map_enqueue().To fix this, change xdp_do_redirect() to react directly to the presence ofthe BPF_F_BROADCAST flag in the 'flags' value in struct bpf_redirect_infoto disambiguate between a single-target and a broadcast redirect. And onlyread the 'map' pointer if the broadcast flag is set, aborting if that hasbeen cleared out in the meantime. This prevents the crash, while keepingthe atomic (cmpxchg-based) clearing of the map pointer itself, and withoutadding any more checks in the non-broadcast fast path.",2024-05-30T18:18:58.870,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-36937

This is due to how Ruby reads the Manifest of Gem files when using Gem::Specification.from_yaml. from_yaml makes use of SafeYAML.load which allows YAML aliases inside the YAML-based metadata of a gem. YAML aliases allow for Denial of Service attacks with so-called `YAML-bombs` (comparable to Billion laughs attacks). This was patched. There is is no action required by users.

Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed.

CVE-2024-35196,1.4,Slack,"Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Sentry's Slack integration incorrectly records the incoming request body in logs. This request data can contain sensitive information, including the deprecated Slack verification token. With this verification token, it is possible under specific configurations, an attacker can forge requests and act as the Slack integration. The request body is leaked in log entries matching `event == ""slack.*"" && name == ""sentry.integrations.slack"" && request_data == *`. The deprecated slack verification token, will be found in the `request_data.token` key. **SaaS users** do not need to take any action. **Self-hosted users** should upgrade to version 24.5.0 or higher, rotate their Slack verification token, and use the Slack Signing Secret instead of the verification token. For users only using the `slack.signing-secret` in their self-hosted configuration, the legacy verification token is not used to verify the webhook payload. It is ignored. Users unable to upgrade should either set the `slack.signing-secret` instead of `slack.verification-token`. The signing secret is Slack's recommended way of authenticating webhooks. By having `slack.singing-secret` set, Sentry self-hosted will no longer use the verification token for authentication of the webhooks, regardless of whether `slack.verification-token` is set or not. Alternatively if the self-hosted instance is unable to be upgraded or re-configured to use the `slack.signing-secret`, the logging configuration can be adjusted to not generate logs from the integration. The default logging configuration can be found in `src/sentry/conf/server.py`. **Services should be restarted once the configuration change is saved.**",2024-05-31T19:14:47.793,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35196
