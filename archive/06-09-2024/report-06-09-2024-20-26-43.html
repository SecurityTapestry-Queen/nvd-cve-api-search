      <td>The 'deploy-website.yml' workflow in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically in the 'main' branch, is vulnerable to secrets exfiltration due to improper authorization. The vulnerability arises from the workflow's explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN, AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The vulnerability is present in the workflow file located at https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/72f4ca88ab569aae47941b3fb0609e57f2e13a27/.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml.</td>

      <td>A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the latest version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm, allowing attackers to bypass the official fix intended to restrict access to intranet IP addresses and protocols. Despite efforts to filter out intranet IP addresses starting with 192, 172, 10, and 127 through regular expressions and limit access protocols to HTTP and HTTPS, attackers can still bypass these restrictions using alternative representations of IP addresses and accessing other ports running on localhost. This vulnerability enables attackers to access any asset on the internal network, attack web services on the internal network, scan hosts on the internal network, and potentially access AWS metadata endpoints. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, which can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.</td>

Specifically, the use of `os.system` to execute the `say` command with user-supplied text allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can inject shell commands. This issue is triggered when the AutoGPT instance is run with the `--speak` option enabled and configured with `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PROVIDER=macos`, reflecting back a shell injection snippet.

      <td>The Lever PDF Embedder plugin 4.4 for WordPress does not block the distribution of polyglot PDF documents that are valid JAR archives. Note: It has been argued that "The vulnerability reported in PDF Embedder Plugin is not valid as the plugin itself doesn't control or manage the file upload process. It only serves the uploaded PDF files and the responsibility of uploading PDF file remains with the Site owner of Wordpress installation, the upload of PDF file is managed by Wordpress core and not by PDF Embedder Plugin. Control &amp; block of polyglot file is required to be taken care at the time of upload, not on showing the file. Moreover, the reference mentions retrieving the files from the browser cache and manually renaming it to jar for executing the file. That refers to a two step non-connected steps which has nothing to do with PDF Embedder.</td>
