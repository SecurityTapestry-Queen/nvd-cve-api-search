CVE-2024-29735,NA,Airflow,"Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories",2024-03-27T12:29:41.530,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-29735

The location of the second memory buffer maydiffer from the one allocated by the image kernel.When the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFIbuffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if thehardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from therestore kernel).It is also possible that the hardware ""forgets"" the address of the memorybuffer when resuming from ""deep"" suspend.

All versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically,  it's possible to crash the repo server component through an out of memory error by pointing it to a malicious Helm registry. The loadRepoIndex() function in the ArgoCD's helm package, does not limit the size nor time while fetching the data. It fetches it and creates a byte slice from the retrieved data in one go. If the registry is implemented to push data continuously, the repo server will keep allocating memory until it runs out of it. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in v2.10.3, v2.9.8, and v2.8.12.",2024-04-01T01:12:59.077,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-29893

CVE-2023-47039,5.9,Windows,"A vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations.",2024-03-28T14:15:13.467,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-47039

However, if the fixup type is EX_TYPE_DEFAULTthe only thing that is raised for an in-kernel #MC is a panic.ex_handler_uaccess() would warn if users gave a non-canonical addresses(with bit 63 clear) to {get, put}_user(), which was unexpected.Therefore, commit  b19b74bc99b1 (""x86/mm: Rework address range check in get_user() and put_user()"")replaced _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() with _ASM_EXTABLE() for {get, put}_user()fixups. However, the new fixup type EX_TYPE_DEFAULT results in a panic.Commit  6014bc27561f (""x86-64: make access_ok() independent of LAM"")added the check gp_fault_address_ok() right before the WARN_ONCE() inex_handler_uaccess() to not warn about non-canonical user addresses dueto LAM.With that in place, revert back to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user()exception fixups in order to be able to handle in-kernel MCEs correctlyagain.
