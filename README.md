# GH Environment Setup
Make Github Environment CI with 2 Secrets: TEAMS_HOOK for MS Teams Webhook, and NVD_API_KEY for NVD CVE API, which is publically available by request

NVD API key is recommended, so you do not get rate-limited between requests

Teams Webhook only needed for alert


# General Notes
Array of keywords for search defined in kwArray

```python
kwArray = ['Apple','IBM','Microsoft']
```
Requires requests and Python 3.10.8
```
pip3 install requests
```
