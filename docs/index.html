      <td>Exposure of temporary credentials in logs in Apache Arrow Rust Object Store (`object_store` crate), version 0.10.1 and earlier on all platforms using AWS WebIdentityTokens. On certain error conditions, the logs may contain the OIDC token passed to  AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html . This allows someone with access to the logs to impersonate that identity, including performing their own calls to AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, until the OIDC token expires. Typically OIDC tokens are valid for up to an hour, although this will vary depending on the issuer.Users are recommended to use a different AWS authentication mechanism, disable logging or upgrade to version 0.10.2, which fixes this issue.Details:When using AWS WebIdentityTokens with the object_store crate, in the event of a failure and automatic retry, the underlying reqwest error, including the full URL with the credentials, potentially in the parameters, is written to the logs. Thanks to Paul Hatcherian for reporting this vulnerability</td>

The patch in commit cb729a3ced0404736dfa0ae768526c82b608657b ensures that cohorts data uploaded to AWS S3 buckets is written with a private ACL. Beyond patching, deployers should also ensure that existing cohorts uploads have a private ACL, or that other precautions are taken to avoid public access.</td>

Note: by itself, this vulnerability does **not** allow an attacker to obtain user credentials, authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, or identity tokens. An attacker could however exploit this vulnerability as part of a phishing attack designed to steal user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.6, 6.3.10, 6.2.5, 6.1.8, and 6.0.5. Duende.IdentityServer 5.1 and earlier and all versions of IdentityServer4 are no longer supported and will not be receiving updates.

Due to the different implementations depending on thearchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarchplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platformfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root causeis that a zero length skb (skb-&gt;len == 0) was put on the queue.This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():\tshutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and nopage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this emptysge is queued into ingress_msg list.And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got bysg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes itto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invokingcopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered bycopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.</td>

      <td>Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.</td>

If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, this MAY permit remote users to gain root privileges.Hadoop 3.3.0 updated the " YARN Secure Containers https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/SecureContainer.html " to add a feature for executing user-submitted applications in isolated linux containers.The native binary HADOOP_HOME/bin/container-executor is used to launch these containers; it must be owned by root and have the suid bit set in order for the YARN processes to run the containers as the specific users submitting the jobs.The patch " YARN-10495 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10495 . make the rpath of container-executor configurable" modified the library loading path for loading .so files from "$ORIGIN/" to ""$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/". This is the a path through which libcrypto.so is located. Thus it is is possible for a user with reduced privileges to install a malicious libcrypto library into a path to which they have write access, invoke the container-executor command, and have their modified library executed as root.If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, and these users' submitted job are executed in the physical host, rather than a container, then the CVE permits remote users to gain root privileges.The fix for the vulnerability is to revert the change, which is done in  YARN-11441 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-11441 , "Revert YARN-10495". This patch is in hadoop-3.3.5.To determine whether a version of container-executor is vulnerable, use the readelf command.

The privileged helper tool creates new VPN connections by executing the openvpn binary located in the /Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources directory. The openvpn binary can be overwritten by the default user, which allows an attacker that has already installed malicious software as the default user to replace the binary.

      <td>OpenProject is open source project management software. Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the "Login required" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers. Version 14.3.0 includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname. Users who aren't able to upgrade immediately may use mod_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in their proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject. Alternatively, they can manually apply the patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86: stop playing stack games in profile_pc()The 'profile_pc()' function is used for timer-based profiling, whichisn't really all that relevant any more to begin with, but it also endsup making assumptions based on the stack layout that aren't necessarilyvalid.Basically, the code tries to account the time spent in spinlocks to thecaller rather than the spinlock, and while I support that as a concept,it's not worth the code complexity or the KASAN warnings when no seriousprofiling is done using timers anyway these days.And the code really does depend on stack layout that is only true in thesimplest of cases.  We've lost the comment at some point (I think whenthe 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:\tAssume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy\tof eflags from PUSHF.which explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off thestack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just checkif they might be eflags or the return pc:\tEflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addressesbut that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lockdebugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stackframe.It causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] andothers [2].With no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.Just for historical interest, here's some background commits relating tothis code from 2006:  0cb91a229364 ("i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels")  31679f38d886 ("Simplify profile_pc on x86-64")and a code unification from 2009:  ef4512882dbe ("x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc")but the basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git tree.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:inet_diag: Initialize pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2KMSAN reported uninit-value access in raw_lookup() [1]. Diag for rawsockets uses the pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2 for theunderlying protocol. This field corresponds to the sdiag_raw_protocolfield in struct inet_diag_req_raw.inet_diag_get_exact_compat() converts inet_diag_req toinet_diag_req_v2, but leaves the pad field uninitialized. So the issueoccurs when raw_lookup() accesses the sdiag_raw_protocol field.Fix this by initializing the pad field ininet_diag_get_exact_compat(). Also, do the same fix ininet_diag_dump_compat() to avoid the similar issue in the future.[1]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in raw_lookup net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:49 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in raw_sock_get+0x657/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_lookup net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:49 [inline] raw_sock_get+0x657/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_diag_dump_one+0xa1/0x660 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:99 inet_diag_cmd_exact+0x7d9/0x980 inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1404 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x469/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282 netlink_rcv_skb+0x537/0x670 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2564 sock_diag_rcv+0x35/0x40 net/core/sock_diag.c:297 netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1335 [inline] netlink_unicast+0xe74/0x1240 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1361 netlink_sendmsg+0x10c6/0x1260 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1905 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0x332/0x3d0 net/socket.c:745 ____sys_sendmsg+0x7f0/0xb70 net/socket.c:2585 ___sys_sendmsg+0x271/0x3b0 net/socket.c:2639 __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2668 [inline] __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2677 [inline] __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2675 [inline] __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x27e/0x4a0 net/socket.c:2675 x64_sys_call+0x135e/0x3ce0 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:47 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xd9/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7fUninit was stored to memory at: raw_sock_get+0x650/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_diag_dump_one+0xa1/0x660 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:99 inet_diag_cmd_exact+0x7d9/0x980 inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1404 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x469/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282 netlink_rcv_skb+0x537/0x670 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2564 sock_diag_rcv+0x35/0x40 net/core/sock_diag.c:297 netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1335 [inline] netlink_unicast+0xe74/0x1240 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1361 netlink_sendmsg+0x10c6/0x1260 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1905 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0x332/0x3d0 net/socket.c:745 ____sys_sendmsg+0x7f0/0xb70 net/socket.c:2585 ___sys_sendmsg+0x271/0x3b0 net/socket.c:2639 __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2668 [inline] __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2677 [inline] __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2675 [inline] __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x27e/0x4a0 net/socket.c:2675 x64_sys_call+0x135e/0x3ce0 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:47 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xd9/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7fLocal variable req.i created at: inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1396 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x2a6/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282CPU: 1 PID: 8888 Comm: syz-executor.6 Not tainted 6.10.0-rc4-00217-g35bb670d65fc #32Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-2.fc40 04/01/2014</td>
