      <td>Exposure of temporary credentials in logs in Apache Arrow Rust Object Store (`object_store` crate), version 0.10.1 and earlier on all platforms using AWS WebIdentityTokens. On certain error conditions, the logs may contain the OIDC token passed to  AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html . This allows someone with access to the logs to impersonate that identity, including performing their own calls to AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, until the OIDC token expires. Typically OIDC tokens are valid for up to an hour, although this will vary depending on the issuer.Users are recommended to use a different AWS authentication mechanism, disable logging or upgrade to version 0.10.2, which fixes this issue.Details:When using AWS WebIdentityTokens with the object_store crate, in the event of a failure and automatic retry, the underlying reqwest error, including the full URL with the credentials, potentially in the parameters, is written to the logs. Thanks to Paul Hatcherian for reporting this vulnerability</td>

The patch in commit cb729a3ced0404736dfa0ae768526c82b608657b ensures that cohorts data uploaded to AWS S3 buckets is written with a private ACL. Beyond patching, deployers should also ensure that existing cohorts uploads have a private ACL, or that other precautions are taken to avoid public access.</td>

Due to the different implementations depending on thearchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarchplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platformfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root causeis that a zero length skb (skb-&gt;len == 0) was put on the queue.This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():\tshutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and nopage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this emptysge is queued into ingress_msg list.And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got bysg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes itto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invokingcopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered bycopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.</td>

A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the "Cloned Website" Canarytoken, whereby the Canarytoken's creator can attack themselves. The creator of a slow-redirect Canarytoken can insert Javascript into the destination URL of their slow redirect token. When the creator later browses the management page for their own Canarytoken, the Javascript executes. This is a self-XSS. An attacker could create a Canarytoken with this self-XSS, and send the management link to a victim. When they click on it, the Javascript would execute. However, no sensitive information (ex. session information) will be disclosed to the malicious actor. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org.

If a webhook is supplied when a  Canarytoken is first created, the site will make a test request to the supplied URL to ensure it accepts alert notification HTTP requests. No safety checks were performed on the URL, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. The SSRF is Blind because the content of the response is not displayed to the creating user; they are simply told whether an error occurred in making the test request.

      <td>Moby is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.0, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.</td>

Microsoft is aware of attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability by using specially crafted packages that include the malware family known as Emotet/Trickbot/Bazaloader.An attacker could craft a malicious attachment to be used in phishing campaigns. The attacker would then have to convince the user to open the specially crafted attachment. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.Please see the Security Updates table for the link to the updated app. Alternatively you can download and install the Installer using the links provided in the FAQ section.Please see the Mitigations and Workaround sections for important information about steps you can take to protect your system from this vulnerability.December 27 2023 Update:In recent months, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has seen an increase in activity from threat actors leveraging social engineering and phishing techniques to target Windows OS users and utilizing the ms-appinstaller URI scheme.To address this increase in activity, we have updated the App Installer to disable the ms-appinstaller protocol by default and recommend other potential mitigations.</td>

      <td>PrivateVPN 2.0.31 for macOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The software installs a privileged helper tool that runs as the root user. This privileged helper tool is installed as a LaunchDaemon and implements an XPC service. The XPC service is responsible for handling new VPN connection operations via the main PrivateVPN application. The privileged helper tool creates new VPN connections by executing the openvpn binary located in the /Applications/PrivateVPN.app/Contents/Resources directory. The openvpn binary can be overwritten by the default user, which allows an attacker that has already installed malicious software as the default user to replace the binary. When a new VPN connection is established, the privileged helper tool will launch this malicious binary, thus allowing an attacker to execute code as the root user. NOTE: the vendor has reportedly indicated that this behavior is "an acceptable part of their software.</td>

Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the "Login required" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers. Version 14.3.0 includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname. Users who aren't able to upgrade immediately may use mod_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in their proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject. Alternatively, they can manually apply the patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject.</td>

However, it's not necessary to make such a large changein order to fix this bug; all we need to do is make sure thatudc-&gt;dev.driver is always NULL.In fact, there is no reason for udc-&gt;dev.driver ever to be set toanything, let alone to the value it currently gets: the address of thegadget's driver.  After all, a gadget driver only knows how to managea gadget, not how to manage a UDC.This patch simply removes the statements in the gadget core that touchudc-&gt;dev.driver.</td>

We've lost the comment at some point (I think whenthe 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:\tAssume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy\tof eflags from PUSHF.which explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off thestack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just checkif they might be eflags or the return pc:\tEflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addressesbut that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lockdebugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stackframe.It causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] andothers [2].With no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.Just for historical interest, here's some background commits relating tothis code from 2006:  0cb91a229364 ("i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels")  31679f38d886 ("Simplify profile_pc on x86-64")and a code unification from 2009:  ef4512882dbe ("x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc")but the basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git tree.</td>

      <td>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:udp: Set SOCK_RCU_FREE earlier in udp_lib_get_port().syzkaller triggered the warning [0] in udp_v4_early_demux().In udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), we do not touch the refcountof the looked-up sk and use sock_pfree() as skb-&gt;destructor, so we checkSOCK_RCU_FREE to ensure that the sk is safe to access during the RCU graceperiod.Currently, SOCK_RCU_FREE is flagged for a bound socket after being putinto the hash table.  Moreover, the SOCK_RCU_FREE check is done too earlyin udp_v[46]_early_demux() and sk_lookup(), so there could be a small racewindow:  CPU1                                 CPU2  ----                                 ----  udp_v4_early_demux()                 udp_lib_get_port()  |                                    |- hlist_add_head_rcu()  |- sk = __udp4_lib_demux_lookup()    |  |- DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(sk_is_refcounted(sk));                                       `- sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_RCU_FREE)We had the same bug in TCP and fixed it in commit 871019b22d1b ("net:set SOCK_RCU_FREE before inserting socket into hashtable").Let's apply the same fix for UDP.[0]:WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11198 at net/ipv4/udp.c:2599 udp_v4_early_demux+0x481/0xb70 net/ipv4/udp.c:2599Modules linked in:CPU: 0 PID: 11198 Comm: syz-executor.1 Not tainted 6.9.0-g93bda33046e7 #13Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:udp_v4_early_demux+0x481/0xb70 net/ipv4/udp.c:2599Code: c5 7a 15 fe bb 01 00 00 00 44 89 e9 31 ff d3 e3 81 e3 bf ef ff ff 89 de e8 2c 74 15 fe 85 db 0f 85 02 06 00 00 e8 9f 7a 15 fe &lt;0f&gt; 0b e8 98 7a 15 fe 49 8d 7e 60 e8 4f 39 2f fe 49 c7 46 60 20 52RSP: 0018:ffffc9000ce3fa58 EFLAGS: 00010293RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: ffffffff8318c92cRDX: ffff888036ccde00 RSI: ffffffff8318c2f1 RDI: 0000000000000001RBP: ffff88805a2dd6e0 R08: 0000000000000001 R09: 0000000000000000R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0001ffffffffffff R12: ffff88805a2dd680R13: 0000000000000007 R14: ffff88800923f900 R15: ffff88805456004eFS:  00007fc449127640(0000) GS:ffff88807dc00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 00007fc449126e38 CR3: 000000003de4b002 CR4: 0000000000770ef0DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000600PKRU: 55555554Call Trace: &lt;TASK&gt; ip_rcv_finish_core.constprop.0+0xbdd/0xd20 net/ipv4/ip_input.c:349 ip_rcv_finish+0xda/0x150 net/ipv4/ip_input.c:447 NF_HOOK include/linux/netfilter.h:314 [inline] NF_HOOK include/linux/netfilter.h:308 [inline] ip_rcv+0x16c/0x180 net/ipv4/ip_input.c:569 __netif_receive_skb_one_core+0xb3/0xe0 net/core/dev.c:5624 __netif_receive_skb+0x21/0xd0 net/core/dev.c:5738 netif_receive_skb_internal net/core/dev.c:5824 [inline] netif_receive_skb+0x271/0x300 net/core/dev.c:5884 tun_rx_batched drivers/net/tun.c:1549 [inline] tun_get_user+0x24db/0x2c50 drivers/net/tun.c:2002 tun_chr_write_iter+0x107/0x1a0 drivers/net/tun.c:2048 new_sync_write fs/read_write.c:497 [inline] vfs_write+0x76f/0x8d0 fs/read_write.c:590 ksys_write+0xbf/0x190 fs/read_write.c:643 __do_sys_write fs/read_write.c:655 [inline] __se_sys_write fs/read_write.c:652 [inline] __x64_sys_write+0x41/0x50 fs/read_write.c:652 x64_sys_call+0xe66/0x1990 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:2 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0x4b/0x110 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53RIP: 0033:0x7fc44a68bc1fCode: 89 54 24 18 48 89 74 24 10 89 7c 24 08 e8 e9 cf f5 ff 48 8b 54 24 18 48 8b 74 24 10 41 89 c0 8b 7c 24 08 b8 01 00 00 00 0f 05 &lt;48&gt; 3d 00 f0 ff ff 77 31 44 89 c7 48 89 44 24 08 e8 3c d0 f5 ff 48RSP: 002b:00007fc449126c90 EFLAGS: 00000293 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 00000000004bc050 RCX: 00007fc44a68bc1fR---truncated---</td>
