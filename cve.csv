CVE-2024-41010,3.6,Atom,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix too early release of tcx_entryPedro Pinto and later independently also Hyunwoo Kim and Wongi Lee reportedan issue that the tcx_entry can be released too early leading to a useafter free (UAF) when an active old-style ingress or clsact qdisc with ashared tc block is later replaced by another ingress or clsact instance.Essentially, the sequence to trigger the UAF (one example) can be as follows:  1. A network namespace is created  2. An ingress qdisc is created. This allocates a tcx_entry, and     &tcx_entry->miniq is stored in the qdisc's miniqp->p_miniq. At the     same time, a tcf block with index 1 is created.  3. chain0 is attached to the tcf block. chain0 must be connected to     the block linked to the ingress qdisc to later reach the function     tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del() which triggers the UAF.  4. Create and graft a clsact qdisc. This causes the ingress qdisc     created in step 1 to be removed, thus freeing the previously linked     tcx_entry:     rtnetlink_rcv_msg()       => tc_modify_qdisc()         => qdisc_create()           => clsact_init() [a]         => qdisc_graft()           => qdisc_destroy()             => __qdisc_destroy()               => ingress_destroy() [b]                 => tcx_entry_free()                   => kfree_rcu() // tcx_entry freed  5. Finally, the network namespace is closed. This registers the     cleanup_net worker, and during the process of releasing the     remaining clsact qdisc, it accesses the tcx_entry that was     already freed in step 4, causing the UAF to occur:     cleanup_net()       => ops_exit_list()         => default_device_exit_batch()           => unregister_netdevice_many()             => unregister_netdevice_many_notify()               => dev_shutdown()                 => qdisc_put()                   => clsact_destroy() [c]                     => tcf_block_put_ext()                       => tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del()                         => tcf_chain_head_change_item()                           => clsact_chain_head_change()                             => mini_qdisc_pair_swap() // UAFThere are also other variants, the gist is to add an ingress (or clsact)qdisc with a specific shared block, then to replace that qdisc, waitingfor the tcx_entry kfree_rcu() to be executed and subsequently accessingthe current active qdisc's miniq one way or another.The correct fix is to turn the miniq_active boolean into a counter. Whatcan be observed, at step 2 above, the counter transitions from 0->1, atstep [a] from 1->2 (in order for the miniq object to remain active duringthe replacement), then in [b] from 2->1 and finally [c] 1->0 with theeventual release. The reference counter in general ranges from [0,2] andit does not need to be atomic since all access to the counter is protectedby the rtnl mutex. With this in place, there is no longer a UAF happeningand the tcx_entry is freed at the correct time.",2024-07-19T15:24:59.137,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-41010

CVE-2024-41010,3.6,GIS,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:bpf: Fix too early release of tcx_entryPedro Pinto and later independently also Hyunwoo Kim and Wongi Lee reportedan issue that the tcx_entry can be released too early leading to a useafter free (UAF) when an active old-style ingress or clsact qdisc with ashared tc block is later replaced by another ingress or clsact instance.Essentially, the sequence to trigger the UAF (one example) can be as follows:  1. A network namespace is created  2. An ingress qdisc is created. This allocates a tcx_entry, and     &tcx_entry->miniq is stored in the qdisc's miniqp->p_miniq. At the     same time, a tcf block with index 1 is created.  3. chain0 is attached to the tcf block. chain0 must be connected to     the block linked to the ingress qdisc to later reach the function     tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del() which triggers the UAF.  4. Create and graft a clsact qdisc. This causes the ingress qdisc     created in step 1 to be removed, thus freeing the previously linked     tcx_entry:     rtnetlink_rcv_msg()       => tc_modify_qdisc()         => qdisc_create()           => clsact_init() [a]         => qdisc_graft()           => qdisc_destroy()             => __qdisc_destroy()               => ingress_destroy() [b]                 => tcx_entry_free()                   => kfree_rcu() // tcx_entry freed  5. Finally, the network namespace is closed. This registers the     cleanup_net worker, and during the process of releasing the     remaining clsact qdisc, it accesses the tcx_entry that was     already freed in step 4, causing the UAF to occur:     cleanup_net()       => ops_exit_list()         => default_device_exit_batch()           => unregister_netdevice_many()             => unregister_netdevice_many_notify()               => dev_shutdown()                 => qdisc_put()                   => clsact_destroy() [c]                     => tcf_block_put_ext()                       => tcf_chain0_head_change_cb_del()                         => tcf_chain_head_change_item()                           => clsact_chain_head_change()                             => mini_qdisc_pair_swap() // UAFThere are also other variants, the gist is to add an ingress (or clsact)qdisc with a specific shared block, then to replace that qdisc, waitingfor the tcx_entry kfree_rcu() to be executed and subsequently accessingthe current active qdisc's miniq one way or another.The correct fix is to turn the miniq_active boolean into a counter. Whatcan be observed, at step 2 above, the counter transitions from 0->1, atstep [a] from 1->2 (in order for the miniq object to remain active duringthe replacement), then in [b] from 2->1 and finally [c] 1->0 with theeventual release. The reference counter in general ranges from [0,2] andit does not need to be atomic since all access to the counter is protectedby the rtnl mutex. With this in place, there is no longer a UAF happeningand the tcx_entry is freed at the correct time.",2024-07-19T15:24:59.137,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-41010

Removing that locking from read_descriptors() exposed it tothe race.The best way to fix the bug is to keep hub_port_init() from changingudev->descriptor once udev has been initialized and registered.Drivers expect the descriptors stored in the kernel to be immutable;we should not undermine this expectation.  In fact, this change shouldhave been made long ago.So now hub_port_init() will take an additional argument, specifying abuffer in which to store the device descriptor it reads.  (If udev hasnot yet been initialized, the buffer pointer will be NULL and thenhub_port_init() will store the device descriptor in udev as before.)This eliminates the data race responsible for the out-of-bounds read.The changes to hub_port_init() appear more extensive than they reallyare, because of indentation changes resulting from an attempt to avoidwriting to other parts of the usb_device structure after it has beeninitialized.

CVE-2024-40640,1.4,Insight,"vodozemac is an open source implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust.  Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack. The use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material. The impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements, as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.  Additionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper. This has been patched in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272 which has been included in release version 0.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

Removing that locking from read_descriptors() exposed it tothe race.The best way to fix the bug is to keep hub_port_init() from changingudev->descriptor once udev has been initialized and registered.Drivers expect the descriptors stored in the kernel to be immutable;we should not undermine this expectation.  In fact, this change shouldhave been made long ago.So now hub_port_init() will take an additional argument, specifying abuffer in which to store the device descriptor it reads.  (If udev hasnot yet been initialized, the buffer pointer will be NULL and thenhub_port_init() will store the device descriptor in udev as before.)This eliminates the data race responsible for the out-of-bounds read.The changes to hub_port_init() appear more extensive than they reallyare, because of indentation changes resulting from an attempt to avoidwriting to other parts of the usb_device structure after it has beeninitialized.  Similar changes should be made to the code that readsthe BOS descriptor, but that can be handled in a separate patch lateron.  This patch is sufficient to fix the bug found by syzbot.",2024-07-16T13:43:58.773,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-52886

Getting that -EIO means that we returnimmediately as we can not iterate over the entire tree.In that case we never update the reserved space for an extent buffer inthe respective block group and space_info object.When this happens we get the following traces when unmounting the fs:[174957.284509] BTRFS: error (device dm-0) in cleanup_transaction:1913: errno=-5 IO failure[174957.286497] BTRFS: error (device dm-0) in free_log_tree:3420: errno=-5 IO failure[174957.399379] ------------[ cut here ]------------[174957.402497] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 3206883 at fs/btrfs/block-group.c:127 btrfs_put_block_group+0x77/0xb0 [btrfs][174957.407523] Modules linked in: btrfs overlay dm_zero (...)[174957.424917] CPU: 2 PID: 3206883 Comm: umount Tainted: G        W         5.16.0-rc5-btrfs-next-109 #1[174957.426689] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.14.0-0-g155821a1990b-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014[174957.428716] RIP: 0010:btrfs_put_block_group+0x77/0xb0 [btrfs][174957.429717] Code: 21 48 8b bd (...)[174957.432867] RSP: 0018:ffffb70d41cffdd0 EFLAGS: 00010206[174957.433632] RAX: 0000000000000001 RBX: ffff8b09c3848000 RCX: ffff8b0758edd1c8[174957.434689] RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffffffc0b467e7 RDI: ffff8b0758edd000[174957.436068] RBP: ffff8b0758edd000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000[174957.437114] R10: 0000000000000246 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffff8b09c3848148[174957.438140] R13: ffff8b09c3848198 R14: ffff8b0758edd188 R15: dead000000000100[174957.439317] FS:  00007f328fb82800(0000) GS:ffff8b0a2d200000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000[174957.440402] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[174957.441164] CR2: 00007fff13563e98 CR3: 0000000404f4e005 CR4: 0000000000370ee0[174957.442117] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000[174957.443076] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400[174957.443948] Call Trace:[174957.444264]  <TASK>[174957.444538]  btrfs_free_block_groups+0x255/0x3c0 [btrfs][174957.445238]  close_ctree+0x301/0x357 [btrfs][174957.445803]  ? call_rcu+0x16c/0x290[174957.446250]  generic_shutdown_super+0x74/0x120[174957.446832]  kill_anon_super+0x14/0x30[174957.447305]  btrfs_kill_super+0x12/0x20 [btrfs][174957.447890]  deactivate_locked_super+0x31/0xa0[174957.448440]  cleanup_mnt+0x147/0x1c0[174957.448888]  task_work_run+0x5c/0xa0[174957.449336]  exit_to_user_mode_prepare+0x1e5/0x1f0[174957.449934]  syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x16/0x40[174957.450512]  do_syscall_64+0x48/0xc0[174957.450980]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae[174957.451605] RIP: 0033:0x7f328fdc4a97[174957.452059] Code: 03 0c 00 f7 (...)[174957.454320] RSP: 002b:00007fff13564ec8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 00000000000000a6[174957.455262] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 00007f328feea264 RCX: 00007f328fdc4a97[174957.456131] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 00000000000000---truncated---",2024-07-16T13:43:58.773,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-48833

CVE-2017-12237,3.6,SSL,"A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS 15.0 through 15.6 and Cisco IOS XE 3.5 through 16.5 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to how an affected device processes certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU utilization, traceback messages, or a reload of the affected device that leads to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that have the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) enabled. Although only IKEv2 packets can be used to trigger this vulnerability, devices that are running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable when ISAKMP is enabled.
