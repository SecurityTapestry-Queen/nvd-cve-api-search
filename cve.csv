CVE-2024-35192,4.0,AWS,"Trivy is a security scanner. Prior to 0.51.2, if a malicious actor is able to trigger Trivy to scan container images from a crafted malicious registry, it could result in the leakage of credentials for legitimate registries such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Cloud Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry (ACR). These tokens can then be used to push/pull images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy has access. Systems are not affected if the default credential provider chain is unable to obtain valid credentials. This vulnerability only applies when scanning container images directly from a registry.

CVE-2023-52707,NA,Amazon,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/psi: Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue()If a non-root cgroup gets removed when there is a thread that registeredtrigger and is polling on a pressure file within the cgroup, the pollingwaitqueue gets freed in the following path: do_rmdir   cgroup_rmdir     kernfs_drain_open_files       cgroup_file_release         cgroup_pressure_release           psi_trigger_destroyHowever, the polling thread still has a reference to the pressure file andwill access the freed waitqueue when the file is closed or upon exit: fput   ep_eventpoll_release     ep_free       ep_remove_wait_queue         remove_wait_queueThis results in use-after-free as pasted below.The fundamental problem here is that cgroup_file_release() (andconsequently waitqueue's lifetime) is not tied to the file's real lifetime.Using wake_up_pollfree() here might be less than ideal, but it is in linewith the comment at commit 42288cb44c4b (""wait: add wake_up_pollfree()"")since the waitqueue's lifetime is not tied to file's one and can beconsidered as another special case. While this would be fixable by somehowmaking cgroup_file_release() be tied to the fput(), it would requiresizable refactoring at cgroups or higher layer which might be morejustifiable if we identify more cases like this.

CVE-2021-47546,NA,Firewall,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv6: fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppressThe kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftablesfirewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routingrules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such scenarios, everyincoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I trackeddown the issue to ca7a03c41753 (""ipv6: do not free rt ifFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule"").The problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` notdecreasing the refcount when needed.How to reproduce: - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop   This can be done with:     sudo nft create table inet test     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop - Run:     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0 - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase   with every incoming ipv6 packet.This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocolspecific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the genericFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.[1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L71[2]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L99",2024-05-24T18:09:20.027,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47546

CVE-2024-35238,3.6,GitHub,"Minder by Stacklok is an open source software supply chain security platform. Minder prior to version 0.0.51 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack which could allow an attacker to crash the Minder server and deny other users access to it. The root cause of the vulnerability is that Minders sigstore verifier reads an untrusted response entirely into memory without enforcing a limit on the response body. An attacker can exploit this by making Minder make a request to an attacker-controlled endpoint which returns a response with a large body which will crash the Minder server. Specifically, the point of failure is where Minder parses the response from the GitHub attestations endpoint in `getAttestationReply`. Here, Minder makes a request to the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint (line 285) and then parses the response into the `AttestationReply` (line 295). The way Minder parses the response on line 295 makes it prone to DoS if the response is large enough. Essentially, the response needs to be larger than the machine has available memory.  Version 0.0.51 contains a patch for this issue.The content that is hosted at the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub attestation endpoint is controlled by users including unauthenticated users to Minders threat model. However, a user will need to configure their own Minder settings to cause Minder to make Minder send a request to fetch the attestations. The user would need to know of a package whose attestations were configured in such a way that they would return a large response when fetching them. As such, the steps needed to carry out this attack would look as such:1. The attacker adds a package to ghcr.io with attestations that can be fetched via the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint.2. The attacker registers on Minder and makes Minder fetch the attestations.3. Minder fetches attestations and crashes thereby being denied of service.",2024-05-27T18:15:09.920,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35238

The actualconditions under which this might occur are unclear [1], but it seemsplausible that this might be triggered if one sibling thread unmaps a pageand invalidates the shared TLB while another sibling thread is executingXRSTOR on the page in question.__fpu__restore_sig() can execute XRSTOR while the hardware registersare preserved on behalf of a different victim task (using thefpu_fpregs_owner_ctx mechanism), and, in theory, XRSTOR could fail butmodify the registers.If this happens, then there is a window in which __fpu__restore_sig()could schedule out and the victim task could schedule back in withoutreloading its own FPU registers. This would result in part of the FPUstate that __fpu__restore_sig() was attempting to load leaking into thevictim task's user-visible state.Invalidate preserved FPU registers on XRSTOR failure to prevent thissituation from corrupting any state.[1] Frequent readers of the errata lists might imagine ""complex    microarchitectural conditions"".",2024-05-21T16:54:26.047,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47226

This allows reference counting and cleanup to be done on the latterwhich simplifies their management a bit. The aux->poke_tab struct, however,did not follow this logic. The initial proposed fix for this use-after-freebug further embedded poke data tracking into the subprogram with properreference counting. However, Daniel and Alexei questioned why we were treatingthese objects special; I agree, its unnecessary. The fix here removes the persubprogram poke table allocation and map tracking and instead simply pointsthe aux->poke_tab pointer at the main programs poke table. This way, maptracking is simplified to the main program and we do not need to manage themper subprogram.This also means, bpf_prog_free_deferred(), which unwinds the program referencecounting and kfrees objects, needs to ensure that we don't try to double freethe poke_tab when free'ing the subprog structures. This is easily solved byNULL'ing the poke_tab pointer. The second detail is to ensure that persubprogram JIT logic only does fixups on poke_tab[] entries it owns. To dothis, we add a pointer in the poke structure to point at the subprogram valueso JITs can easily check while walking the poke_tab structure if the currententry belongs to the current program. The aux pointer is stable and thereforesuitable for such comparison. On the jit_subprogs() error path, we omitcleaning up the poke->aux field because these are only ever referenced fromthe JIT side, but on error we will never make it to the JIT, so its fine toleave them dangling. Removing these pointers would complicate the error pathfor no reason. However, we do need to untrack all poke descriptors from themain program as otherwise they could race with the freeing of JIT memory fromthe subprograms.

CVE-2024-35237,3.6,Node.js,"MIT IdentiBot is an open-source Discord bot written in Node.js that verifies individuals' affiliations with MIT, grants them roles in a Discord server, and stores information about them in a database backend. A vulnerability that exists prior to commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e impacts all users who have performed verification with an instance of MIT IdentiBot that meets the following conditions: The instance of IdentiBot is tied to a ""public"" Discord application—i.e., users other than the API access registrant can add it to servers; *and* the instance has not yet been patched. In affected versions, IdentiBot does not check that a server is authorized before allowing members to execute slash and user commands in that server. As a result, any user can join IdentiBot to their server and then use commands (e.g., `/kerbid`) to reveal the full name and other information about a Discord user who has verified their affiliation with MIT using IdentiBot. The latest version of MIT IdentiBot contains a patch for this vulnerability (implemented in commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e). There is no way to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability without the patch.

The latter takes place forexample when user changes queue count on an interface via ethtool'sset_channels().There is an issue around the bpf_prog refcounting when VSI is beingrebuilt - since ice_prepare_xdp_rings() is called with vsi->xdp_prog asan argument that is used later on by ice_vsi_assign_bpf_prog(), samebpf_prog pointers are swapped with each other. Then it is alsointerpreted as an 'old_prog' which in turn causes us to callbpf_prog_put on it that will decrement its refcount.Below splat can be interpreted in a way that due to zero refcount of abpf_prog it is wiped out from the system while kernel still tries torefer to it:[  481.069429] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc9000640f038[  481.077390] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode[  481.083335] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page[  481.089276] PGD 100000067 P4D 100000067 PUD 1001cb067 PMD 106d2b067 PTE 0[  481.097141] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI[  481.101980] CPU: 12 PID: 3339 Comm: sudo Tainted: G           OE     5.15.0-rc5+ #1[  481.110840] Hardware name: Intel Corp.

SMM hasan entirely different set of memslots, and so the initial lookup can finda memslot (SMM=0) and then explode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1).  general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]  CPU: 1 PID: 8410 Comm: syz-executor382 Not tainted 5.13.0-rc5-syzkaller #0  Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 01/01/2011  RIP: 0010:__gfn_to_rmap arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:935 [inline]  RIP: 0010:gfn_to_rmap+0x2b0/0x4d0 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:947  Code: <42> 80 3c 20 00 74 08 4c 89 ff e8 f1 79 a9 00 4c 89 fb 4d 8b 37 44  RSP: 0018:ffffc90000ffef98 EFLAGS: 00010246  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff888015b9f414 RCX: ffff888019669c40  RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000001 RDI: 0000000000000001  RBP: 0000000000000001 R08: ffffffff811d9cdb R09: ffffed10065a6002  R10: ffffed10065a6002 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: dffffc0000000000  R13: 0000000000000003 R14: 0000000000000001 R15: 0000000000000000  FS:  000000000124b300(0000) GS:ffff8880b9b00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000028e31000 CR4: 00000000001526e0  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400  Call Trace:   rmap_add arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:965 [inline]   mmu_set_spte+0x862/0xe60 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:2604   __direct_map arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:2862 [inline]   direct_page_fault+0x1f74/0x2b70 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:3769   kvm_mmu_do_page_fault arch/x86/kvm/mmu.h:124 [inline]   kvm_mmu_page_fault+0x199/0x1440 arch/x86/kvm/mmu/mmu.c:5065   vmx_handle_exit+0x26/0x160 arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:6122   vcpu_enter_guest+0x3bdd/0x9630 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9428   vcpu_run+0x416/0xc20 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9494   kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x4e8/0xa40 arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:9722   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x70f/0xbb0 arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:3460   vfs_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:51 [inline]   __do_sys_ioctl fs/ioctl.c:1069 [inline]   __se_sys_ioctl+0xfb/0x170 fs/ioctl.c:1055   do_syscall_64+0x3f/0xb0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:47   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae  RIP: 0033:0x440ce9",2024-05-21T16:54:26.047,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47230
CVE-2021-47262,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86: Ensure liveliness of nested VM-Enter fail tracepoint messageUse the __string() machinery provided by the tracing subystem to make acopy of the string literals consumed by the ""nested VM-Enter failed""tracepoint.  A complete copy is necessary to ensure that the tracepointcan't outlive the data/memory it consumes and deference stale memory.Because the tracepoint itself is defined by kvm, if kvm-intel and/orkvm-amd are built as modules, the memory holding the string literalsdefined by the vendor modules will be freed when the module is unloaded,whereas the tracepoint and its data in the ring buffer will live untilkvm is unloaded (or ""indefinitely"" if kvm is built-in).This bug has existed since the tracepoint was added, but was recentlyexposed by a new check in tracing to detect exactly this type of bug.  fmt: '%s%s  ' current_buffer: ' vmx_dirty_log_t-140127  [003] ....  kvm_nested_vmenter_failed: '  WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 140134 at kernel/trace/trace.c:3759 trace_check_vprintf+0x3be/0x3e0  CPU: 3 PID: 140134 Comm: less Not tainted 5.13.0-rc1-ce2e73ce600a-req #184  Hardware name: ASUS Q87M-E/Q87M-E, BIOS 1102 03/03/2014  RIP: 0010:trace_check_vprintf+0x3be/0x3e0  Code: <0f> 0b 44 8b 4c 24 1c e9 a9 fe ff ff c6 44 02 ff 00 49 8b 97 b0 20  RSP: 0018:ffffa895cc37bcb0 EFLAGS: 00010282  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffa895cc37bd08 RCX: 0000000000000027  RDX: 0000000000000027 RSI: 00000000ffffdfff RDI: ffff9766cfad74f8  RBP: ffffffffc0a041d4 R08: ffff9766cfad74f0 R09: ffffa895cc37bad8  R10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffffffffc0a041d4  R13: ffffffffc0f4dba8 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ffff976409f2c000  FS:  00007f92fa200740(0000) GS:ffff9766cfac0000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000559bd11b0000 CR3: 000000019fbaa002 CR4: 00000000001726e0  Call Trace:   trace_event_printf+0x5e/0x80   trace_raw_output_kvm_nested_vmenter_failed+0x3a/0x60 [kvm]   print_trace_line+0x1dd/0x4e0   s_show+0x45/0x150   seq_read_iter+0x2d5/0x4c0   seq_read+0x106/0x150   vfs_read+0x98/0x180   ksys_read+0x5f/0xe0   do_syscall_64+0x40/0xb0   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae",2024-05-21T16:54:26.047,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47262
