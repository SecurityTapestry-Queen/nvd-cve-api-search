Due to the different implementations depending on thearchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarchplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platformfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root causeis that a zero length skb (skb->len == 0) was put on the queue.This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():	shutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and nopage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this emptysge is queued into ingress_msg list.And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got bysg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes itto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invokingcopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered bycopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.",2024-07-29T16:21:52.517,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-41048

A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.Using a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.A security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.Docker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.docker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability.

CVE-2024-41666,3.4,Kubernetes,"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information.

Due to the different implementations depending on thearchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarchplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platformfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root causeis that a zero length skb (skb->len == 0) was put on the queue.This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():	shutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and nopage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this emptysge is queued into ingress_msg list.And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got bysg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes itto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invokingcopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered bycopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.",2024-07-29T16:21:52.517,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-41048

CVE-2024-41801,1.4,Phishing,"OpenProject is open source project management software. Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the ""Login required"" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers. Version 14.3.0 includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname. Users who aren't able to upgrade immediately may use mod_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in their proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject. Alternatively, they can manually apply the patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject.",2024-07-26T12:38:41.683,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-41801

Note: by itself, this vulnerability does **not** allow an attacker to obtain user credentials, authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, or identity tokens. An attacker could however exploit this vulnerability as part of a phishing attack designed to steal user credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.6, 6.3.10, 6.2.5, 6.1.8, and 6.0.5. Duende.IdentityServer 5.1 and earlier and all versions of IdentityServer4 are no longer supported and will not be receiving updates.

Due to the different implementations depending on thearchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarchplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platformfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root causeis that a zero length skb (skb->len == 0) was put on the queue.This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():	shutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and nopage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this emptysge is queued into ingress_msg list.And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got bysg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes itto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invokingcopy_page_to_iter().

Due to the different implementations depending on thearchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarchplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platformfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root causeis that a zero length skb (skb->len == 0) was put on the queue.This zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),invoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():	shutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);In this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and nopage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this emptysge is queued into ingress_msg list.And in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got bysg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes itto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.To solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),if copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invokingcopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered bycopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.",2024-07-29T16:21:52.517,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-41048
CVE-2024-42096,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86: stop playing stack games in profile_pc()The 'profile_pc()' function is used for timer-based profiling, whichisn't really all that relevant any more to begin with, but it also endsup making assumptions based on the stack layout that aren't necessarilyvalid.Basically, the code tries to account the time spent in spinlocks to thecaller rather than the spinlock, and while I support that as a concept,it's not worth the code complexity or the KASAN warnings when no seriousprofiling is done using timers anyway these days.And the code really does depend on stack layout that is only true in thesimplest of cases.  We've lost the comment at some point (I think whenthe 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:	Assume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy	of eflags from PUSHF.which explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off thestack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just checkif they might be eflags or the return pc:	Eflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addressesbut that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lockdebugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stackframe.It causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] andothers [2].With no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.Just for historical interest, here's some background commits relating tothis code from 2006:  0cb91a229364 (""i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels"")  31679f38d886 (""Simplify profile_pc on x86-64"")and a code unification from 2009:  ef4512882dbe (""x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc"")but the basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git tree.",2024-07-30T13:33:30.653,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-42096

CVE-2024-42106,NA,X64,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:inet_diag: Initialize pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2KMSAN reported uninit-value access in raw_lookup() [1]. Diag for rawsockets uses the pad field in struct inet_diag_req_v2 for theunderlying protocol. This field corresponds to the sdiag_raw_protocolfield in struct inet_diag_req_raw.inet_diag_get_exact_compat() converts inet_diag_req toinet_diag_req_v2, but leaves the pad field uninitialized. So the issueoccurs when raw_lookup() accesses the sdiag_raw_protocol field.Fix this by initializing the pad field ininet_diag_get_exact_compat(). Also, do the same fix ininet_diag_dump_compat() to avoid the similar issue in the future.[1]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in raw_lookup net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:49 [inline]BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in raw_sock_get+0x657/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_lookup net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:49 [inline] raw_sock_get+0x657/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_diag_dump_one+0xa1/0x660 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:99 inet_diag_cmd_exact+0x7d9/0x980 inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1404 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x469/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282 netlink_rcv_skb+0x537/0x670 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2564 sock_diag_rcv+0x35/0x40 net/core/sock_diag.c:297 netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1335 [inline] netlink_unicast+0xe74/0x1240 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1361 netlink_sendmsg+0x10c6/0x1260 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1905 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0x332/0x3d0 net/socket.c:745 ____sys_sendmsg+0x7f0/0xb70 net/socket.c:2585 ___sys_sendmsg+0x271/0x3b0 net/socket.c:2639 __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2668 [inline] __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2677 [inline] __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2675 [inline] __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x27e/0x4a0 net/socket.c:2675 x64_sys_call+0x135e/0x3ce0 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:47 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xd9/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7fUninit was stored to memory at: raw_sock_get+0x650/0x800 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:71 raw_diag_dump_one+0xa1/0x660 net/ipv4/raw_diag.c:99 inet_diag_cmd_exact+0x7d9/0x980 inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1404 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x469/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282 netlink_rcv_skb+0x537/0x670 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2564 sock_diag_rcv+0x35/0x40 net/core/sock_diag.c:297 netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1335 [inline] netlink_unicast+0xe74/0x1240 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1361 netlink_sendmsg+0x10c6/0x1260 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1905 sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:730 [inline] __sock_sendmsg+0x332/0x3d0 net/socket.c:745 ____sys_sendmsg+0x7f0/0xb70 net/socket.c:2585 ___sys_sendmsg+0x271/0x3b0 net/socket.c:2639 __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2668 [inline] __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2677 [inline] __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c:2675 [inline] __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x27e/0x4a0 net/socket.c:2675 x64_sys_call+0x135e/0x3ce0 arch/x86/include/generated/asm/syscalls_64.h:47 do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:52 [inline] do_syscall_64+0xd9/0x1e0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:83 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7fLocal variable req.i created at: inet_diag_get_exact_compat net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1396 [inline] inet_diag_rcv_msg_compat+0x2a6/0x530 net/ipv4/inet_diag.c:1426 sock_diag_rcv_msg+0x23d/0x740 net/core/sock_diag.c:282CPU: 1 PID: 8888 Comm: syz-executor.6 Not tainted 6.10.0-rc4-00217-g35bb670d65fc #32Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-2.fc40 04/01/2014",2024-07-30T13:32:45.943,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-42106
