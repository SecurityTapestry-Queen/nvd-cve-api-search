CVE-2023-40273,5.9,Airflow,"The session fixation vulnerability allowed the authenticated user to continue accessing Airflow webserver even after the password of the user has been reset by the admin - up until the expiry of the session of the user.

When using the securecookie session backend, the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver (and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI.

CVE-2023-40021,3.6,CSRF,"Oppia is an online learning platform. When comparing a received CSRF token against the expected token, Oppia uses the string equality operator (`==`), which is not safe against timing attacks. By repeatedly submitting invalid tokens, an attacker can brute-force the expected CSRF token character by character. Once they have recovered the token, they can then submit a forged request on behalf of a logged-in user and execute privileged actions on that user's behalf. In particular the function to validate received CSRF tokens is at `oppia.core.controllers.base.CsrfTokenManager.is_csrf_token_valid`. An attacker who can lure a logged-in Oppia user to a malicious website can perform any change on Oppia that the user is authorized to do, including changing profile information; creating, deleting, and changing explorations; etc. Note that the attacker cannot change a user's login credentials. An attack would need to complete within 1 second because every second, the time used in computing the token changes.

CVE-2023-2650,3.6,Cryptograph,"Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers ordata containing them may be very slow.Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any ofthe OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no messagesize limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing thosemessages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translatean ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSLtype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are thesub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated byperiods.When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundredsof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very longtime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of thesub-identifiers in bytes (*).With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECTIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetchingalgorithms.Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structureAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specifywhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt ordecrypt, or digest passed data.Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data areaffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purposeof display, the severity is considered low.In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this onlyimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled clientauthentication.In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a waythat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considerednot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,and the severity is therefore considered low.",2023-08-29T18:04:28.613,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-2650

A Mass assignment vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 that allows a non-admin user to escalate privileges to those of an admin user. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server.",2023-08-25T03:55:07.777,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-32079
