CVE-2022-3028,5.9,.NET Framework,A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a socket.,2023-05-26T19:42:22.107,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-3028
CVE-2023-30549,5.9,AWS,"Apptainer is an open source container platform for Linux. There is an ext4 use-after-free flaw that is exploitable through versions of Apptainer < 1.1.0, installations that include apptainer-suid < 1.1.8, and all versions of Singularity in their default configurations on older operating systems where that CVE has not been patched. That includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Debian 10 buster (unless the linux-5.10 package is installed), Ubuntu 18.04 bionic and Ubuntu 20.04 focal. Use-after-free flaws in the kernel can be used to attack the kernel for denial of service and potentially for privilege escalation. Apptainer 1.1.8 includes a patch that by default disables mounting of extfs filesystem types in setuid-root mode, while continuing to allow mounting of extfs filesystems in non-setuid ""rootless"" mode using fuse2fs. Some workarounds are possible. Either do not install apptainer-suid (for versions 1.1.0 through 1.1.7) or set `allow setuid = no` in apptainer.conf (or singularity.conf for singularity versions). This requires having unprivileged user namespaces enabled and except for apptainer 1.1.x versions will disallow mounting of sif files, extfs files, and squashfs files in addition to other, less significant impacts. (Encrypted sif files are also not supported unprivileged in apptainer 1.1.x.). Alternatively, use the `limit containers` options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf to limit sif files to trusted users, groups, and/or paths, and set `allow container extfs = no` to disallow mounting of extfs overlay files. The latter option by itself does not disallow mounting of extfs overlay partitions inside SIF files, so that's why the former options are also needed.",2023-05-26T21:15:19.493,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-30549

CVE-2023-2650,NA,CRM,"Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers ordata containing them may be very slow.Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any ofthe OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no messagesize limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing thosemessages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translatean ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSLtype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are thesub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated byperiods.When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundredsof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very longtime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of thesub-identifiers in bytes (*).With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECTIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetchingalgorithms.Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structureAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specifywhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt ordecrypt, or digest passed data.Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data areaffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purposeof display, the severity is considered low.In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this onlyimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled clientauthentication.In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,such as X.509 certificates.

CVE-2023-32322,3.6,EMC,"Ombi is an open source application which allows users to request specific media from popular self-hosted streaming servers. Versions prior to 4.38.2 contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability where an Ombi administrative user may access files available to the Ombi server process on the host operating system. Ombi administrators may not always be local system administrators and so this may violate the security expectations of the system. The arbitrary file read vulnerability was present in `ReadLogFile` and `Download` endpoints in `SystemControllers.cs` as the parameter `logFileName` is not sanitized before being combined with the `Logs` directory. When using `Path.Combine(arg1, arg2, arg3)`, an attacker may be able to escape to folders/files outside of `Path.Combine(arg1, arg2)` by using "".."" in `arg3`. In addition, by specifying an absolute path for `arg3`, `Path.Combine` will completely ignore the first two arguments and just return just `arg3`. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure. The Ombi `documentation` suggests running Ombi as a Service with Administrator privileges. An attacker targeting such an application may be able to read the files of any Windows user on the host machine and certain system files. This issue has been addressed in commit `b8a8f029` and in release version 4.38.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2023-26048,1.4,Eclipse,"Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and very large content. This happens even with the default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).",2023-05-26T20:15:37.117,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-26048
CVE-2023-26049,1.4,Eclipse,"Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `""` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=""b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d""` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and users are advised to upgrade.

Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than required to hold the parsed headers.

CVE-2023-24536,3.6,Golang,"Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts.

CVE-2023-31128,5.2,Nextcloud,"NextCloud Cookbook is a recipe library app. Prior to commit a46d9855 on the `master` branch and commit 489bb744 on the `main-0.9.x` branch, the `pull-checks.yml` workflow is vulnerable to command injection attacks because of using an untrusted `github.head_ref` field. The `github.head_ref` value is an attacker-controlled value. Assigning the value to `zzz"";echo${IFS}""hello"";#` can lead to command injection. Since the permission is not restricted, the attacker has a write-access to the repository. This issue is fixed in commit a46d9855 on the `master` branch and commit 489bb744 on the `main-0.9.x` branch. There is no risk for the user of the app within the NextCloud server.

CVE-2023-32689,4.0,Node.js,"Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.An additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.The fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default.

CVE-2023-2650,NA,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers ordata containing them may be very slow.Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any ofthe OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no messagesize limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing thosemessages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translatean ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSLtype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are thesub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated byperiods.When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundredsof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very longtime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of thesub-identifiers in bytes (*).With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECTIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetchingalgorithms.Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structureAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specifywhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt ordecrypt, or digest passed data.Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data areaffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purposeof display, the severity is considered low.In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this onlyimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled clientauthentication.In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a waythat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considerednot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,and the severity is therefore considered low.",2023-06-01T00:15:09.597,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-2650

CVE-2023-32689,4.0,Phishing,"Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a company's official website domain.An additional security issue arises when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage and then share it with the attacker.The fix included in versions 5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option `fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML file extensions, which this fix disables by default.

CVE-2023-30549,5.9,SUSE,"Apptainer is an open source container platform for Linux. There is an ext4 use-after-free flaw that is exploitable through versions of Apptainer < 1.1.0, installations that include apptainer-suid < 1.1.8, and all versions of Singularity in their default configurations on older operating systems where that CVE has not been patched. That includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Debian 10 buster (unless the linux-5.10 package is installed), Ubuntu 18.04 bionic and Ubuntu 20.04 focal. Use-after-free flaws in the kernel can be used to attack the kernel for denial of service and potentially for privilege escalation. Apptainer 1.1.8 includes a patch that by default disables mounting of extfs filesystem types in setuid-root mode, while continuing to allow mounting of extfs filesystems in non-setuid ""rootless"" mode using fuse2fs. Some workarounds are possible. Either do not install apptainer-suid (for versions 1.1.0 through 1.1.7) or set `allow setuid = no` in apptainer.conf (or singularity.conf for singularity versions). This requires having unprivileged user namespaces enabled and except for apptainer 1.1.x versions will disallow mounting of sif files, extfs files, and squashfs files in addition to other, less significant impacts. (Encrypted sif files are also not supported unprivileged in apptainer 1.1.x.). Alternatively, use the `limit containers` options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf to limit sif files to trusted users, groups, and/or paths, and set `allow container extfs = no` to disallow mounting of extfs overlay files.

CVE-2022-42336,1.4,Xen,"Mishandling of guest SSBD selection on AMD hardware The current logic to set SSBD on AMD Family 17h and Hygon Family 18h processors requires that the setting of SSBD is coordinated at a core level, as the setting is shared between threads. Logic was introduced to keep track of how many threads require SSBD active in order to coordinate it, such logic relies on using a per-core counter of threads that have SSBD active. When running on the mentioned hardware, it's possible for a guest to under or overflow the thread counter, because each write to VIRT_SPEC_CTRL.SSBD by the guest gets propagated to the helper that does the per-core active accounting. Underflowing the counter causes the value to get saturated, and thus attempts for guests running on the same core to set SSBD won't have effect because the hypervisor assumes it's already active.",2023-05-27T03:15:34.047,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-42336

CVE-2023-32681,4.0,X86,"Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.",2023-05-28T02:28:04.970,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-32681
