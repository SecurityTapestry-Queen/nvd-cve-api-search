CVE-2024-35192,4.0,AWS,"Trivy is a security scanner. Prior to 0.51.2, if a malicious actor is able to trigger Trivy to scan container images from a crafted malicious registry, it could result in the leakage of credentials for legitimate registries such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Cloud Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry (ACR). These tokens can then be used to push/pull images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy has access. Systems are not affected if the default credential provider chain is unable to obtain valid credentials. This vulnerability only applies when scanning container images directly from a registry.

CVE-2023-52707,NA,Amazon,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:sched/psi: Fix use-after-free in ep_remove_wait_queue()If a non-root cgroup gets removed when there is a thread that registeredtrigger and is polling on a pressure file within the cgroup, the pollingwaitqueue gets freed in the following path: do_rmdir   cgroup_rmdir     kernfs_drain_open_files       cgroup_file_release         cgroup_pressure_release           psi_trigger_destroyHowever, the polling thread still has a reference to the pressure file andwill access the freed waitqueue when the file is closed or upon exit: fput   ep_eventpoll_release     ep_free       ep_remove_wait_queue         remove_wait_queueThis results in use-after-free as pasted below.The fundamental problem here is that cgroup_file_release() (andconsequently waitqueue's lifetime) is not tied to the file's real lifetime.Using wake_up_pollfree() here might be less than ideal, but it is in linewith the comment at commit 42288cb44c4b (""wait: add wake_up_pollfree()"")since the waitqueue's lifetime is not tied to file's one and can beconsidered as another special case. While this would be fixable by somehowmaking cgroup_file_release() be tied to the fput(), it would requiresizable refactoring at cgroups or higher layer which might be morejustifiable if we identify more cases like this.

CVE-2024-35875,NA,Cryptograph,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/coco: Require seeding RNG with RDRAND on CoCo systemsThere are few uses of CoCo that don't rely on working cryptography andhence a working RNG. Unfortunately, the CoCo threat model means that theVM host cannot be trusted and may actively work against guests toextract secrets or manipulate computation. Since a malicious host canmodify or observe nearly all inputs to guests, the only remaining sourceof entropy for CoCo guests is RDRAND.If RDRAND is broken -- due to CPU hardware fault -- the RNG as a wholeis meant to gracefully continue on gathering entropy from other sources,but since there aren't other sources on CoCo, this is catastrophic.This is mostly a concern at boot time when initially seeding the RNG, asafter that the consequences of a broken RDRAND are much moretheoretical.So, try at boot to seed the RNG using 256 bits of RDRAND output. If thisfails, panic(). This will also trigger if the system is booted withoutRDRAND, as RDRAND is essential for a safe CoCo boot.Add this deliberately to be ""just a CoCo x86 driver feature"" and notpart of the RNG itself. Many device drivers and platforms have somedesire to contribute something to the RNG, and add_device_randomness()is specifically meant for this purpose.Any driver can call it with seed data of any quality, or even garbagequality, and it can only possibly make the quality of the RNG better orhave no effect, but can never make it worse.Rather than trying to build something into the core of the RNG, considerthe particular CoCo issue just a CoCo issue, and therefore separate itall out into driver (well, arch/platform) code.

CVE-2021-47552,NA,Dell,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:blk-mq: cancel blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue and disk_release()For avoiding to slow down queue destroy, we don't callblk_mq_quiesce_queue() in blk_cleanup_queue(), instead of delaying tocancel dispatch work in blk_release_queue().However, this way has caused kernel oops[1], reported by Changhui. The logshows that scsi_device can be freed before running blk_release_queue(),which is expected too since scsi_device is released after the scsi diskis closed and the scsi_device is removed.Fixes the issue by canceling blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue()and disk_release():1) when disk_release() is run, the disk has been closed, and any syncdispatch activities have been done, so canceling dispatch work is enough toquiesce filesystem I/O dispatch activity.2) in blk_cleanup_queue(), we only focus on passthrough request, andpassthrough request is always explicitly allocated & freed byits caller, so once queue is frozen, all sync dispatch activityfor passthrough request has been done, then it is enough to just canceldispatch work for avoiding any dispatch activity.[1] kernel panic log[12622.769416] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000300[12622.777186] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode[12622.782918] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page[12622.788649] PGD 0 P4D 0[12622.791474] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI[12622.796138] CPU: 10 PID: 744 Comm: kworker/10:1H Kdump: loaded Not tainted 5.15.0+ #1[12622.804877] Hardware name: Dell Inc.

CVE-2024-35884,NA,Endpoint,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:udp: do not accept non-tunnel GSO skbs landing in a tunnelWhen rx-udp-gro-forwarding is enabled UDP packets might be GROed whenbeing forwarded. If such packets might land in a tunnel this can causevarious issues and udp_gro_receive makes sure this isn't the case bylooking for a matching socket. This is performed inudp4/6_gro_lookup_skb but only in the current netns. This is an issuewith tunneled packets when the endpoint is in another netns. In suchcases the packets will be GROed at the UDP level, which leads to variousissues later on. The same thing can happen with rx-gro-list.We saw this with geneve packets being GROed at the UDP level. In suchcase gso_size is set; later the packet goes through the geneve rx path,the geneve header is pulled, the offset are adjusted and frag_list skbsare not adjusted with regard to geneve. When those skbs hitskb_fragment, it will misbehave. Different outcomes are possibledepending on what the GROed skbs look like; from corrupted packets tokernel crashes.One example is a BUG_ON[1] triggered in skb_segment while processing thefrag_list. Because gso_size is wrong (geneve header was pulled)skb_segment thinks there is ""geneve header size"" of data in frag_list,although it's in fact the next packet. The BUG_ON itself has nothing todo with the issue. This is only one of the potential issues.Looking up for a matching socket in udp_gro_receive is fragile: thelookup could be extended to all netns (not speaking about performances)but nothing prevents those packets from being modified in between and wecould still not find a matching socket. It's OK to keep the currentlogic there as it should cover most cases but we also need to make surewe handle tunnel packets being GROed too early.This is done by extending the checks in udp_unexpected_gso: GSO packetslacking the SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL/_CSUM bits and landing in a tunnel mustbe segmented.[1] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:4408!

In such scenarios, everyincoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I trackeddown the issue to ca7a03c41753 (""ipv6: do not free rt ifFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule"").The problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` notdecreasing the refcount when needed.How to reproduce: - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop   This can be done with:     sudo nft create table inet test     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop - Run:     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0 - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase   with every incoming ipv6 packet.This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocolspecific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the genericFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.[1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L71[2]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L99",2024-05-24T18:09:20.027,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47546

CVE-2022-48689,5.9,Google,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:tcp: TX zerocopy should not sense pfmemalloc statusWe got a recent syzbot report [1] showing a possible misuseof pfmemalloc page status in TCP zerocopy paths.Indeed, for pages coming from user space or other layers,using page_is_pfmemalloc() is moot, and possibly could givefalse positives.There has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust,but not using it in the first place in this context is probably better,removing cpu cycles.Note to stable teams :You need to backport 84ce071e38a6 (""net: introduce__skb_fill_page_desc_noacc"") as a prereq.Race is more probable after commit c07aea3ef4d4(""mm: add a signature in struct page"") because page_is_pfmemalloc()is now using low order bit from page->lru.next, which can changemore often than page->index.Low order bit should never be set for lru.next (when used as an anchorin LRU list), so KCSAN report is mostly a false positive.Backporting to older kernel versions seems not necessary.[1]BUG: KCSAN: data-race in lru_add_fn / tcp_build_fragwrite to 0xffffea0004a1d2c8 of 8 bytes by task 18600 on cpu 0:__list_add include/linux/list.h:73 [inline]list_add include/linux/list.h:88 [inline]lruvec_add_folio include/linux/mm_inline.h:105 [inline]lru_add_fn+0x440/0x520 mm/swap.c:228folio_batch_move_lru+0x1e1/0x2a0 mm/swap.c:246folio_batch_add_and_move mm/swap.c:263 [inline]folio_add_lru+0xf1/0x140 mm/swap.c:490filemap_add_folio+0xf8/0x150 mm/filemap.c:948__filemap_get_folio+0x510/0x6d0 mm/filemap.c:1981pagecache_get_page+0x26/0x190 mm/folio-compat.c:104grab_cache_page_write_begin+0x2a/0x30 mm/folio-compat.c:116ext4_da_write_begin+0x2dd/0x5f0 fs/ext4/inode.c:2988generic_perform_write+0x1d4/0x3f0 mm/filemap.c:3738ext4_buffered_write_iter+0x235/0x3e0 fs/ext4/file.c:270ext4_file_write_iter+0x2e3/0x1210call_write_iter include/linux/fs.h:2187 [inline]new_sync_write fs/read_write.c:491 [inline]vfs_write+0x468/0x760 fs/read_write.c:578ksys_write+0xe8/0x1a0 fs/read_write.c:631__do_sys_write fs/read_write.c:643 [inline]__se_sys_write fs/read_write.c:640 [inline]__x64_sys_write+0x3e/0x50 fs/read_write.c:640do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline]do_syscall_64+0x2b/0x70 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcdread to 0xffffea0004a1d2c8 of 8 bytes by task 18611 on cpu 1:page_is_pfmemalloc include/linux/mm.h:1740 [inline]__skb_fill_page_desc include/linux/skbuff.h:2422 [inline]skb_fill_page_desc include/linux/skbuff.h:2443 [inline]tcp_build_frag+0x613/0xb20 net/ipv4/tcp.c:1018do_tcp_sendpages+0x3e8/0xaf0 net/ipv4/tcp.c:1075tcp_sendpage_locked net/ipv4/tcp.c:1140 [inline]tcp_sendpage+0x89/0xb0 net/ipv4/tcp.c:1150inet_sendpage+0x7f/0xc0 net/ipv4/af_inet.c:833kernel_sendpage+0x184/0x300 net/socket.c:3561sock_sendpage+0x5a/0x70 net/socket.c:1054pipe_to_sendpage+0x128/0x160 fs/splice.c:361splice_from_pipe_feed fs/splice.c:415 [inline]__splice_from_pipe+0x222/0x4d0 fs/splice.c:559splice_from_pipe fs/splice.c:594 [inline]generic_splice_sendpage+0x89/0xc0 fs/splice.c:743do_splice_from fs/splice.c:764 [inline]direct_splice_actor+0x80/0xa0 fs/splice.c:931splice_direct_to_actor+0x305/0x620 fs/splice.c:886do_splice_direct+0xfb/0x180 fs/splice.c:974do_sendfile+0x3bf/0x910 fs/read_write.c:1249__do_sys_sendfile64 fs/read_write.c:1317 [inline]__se_sys_sendfile64 fs/read_write.c:1303 [inline]__x64_sys_sendfile64+0x10c/0x150 fs/read_write.c:1303do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c:50 [inline]do_syscall_64+0x2b/0x70 arch/x86/entry/common.c:80entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcdvalue changed: 0x0000000000000000 -> 0xffffea0004a1d288Reported by Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer on:CPU: 1 PID: 18611 Comm: syz-executor.4 Not tainted 6.0.0-rc2-syzkaller-00248-ge022620b5d05-dirty #0Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 07/22/2022",2024-05-23T20:33:57.590,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-48689

CVE-2024-35911,NA,Intel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ice: fix memory corruption bug with suspend and rebuildThe ice driver would previously panic after suspend. This is causedfrom the driver *only* calling the ice_vsi_free_q_vectors() function byitself, when it is suspending. Since commit b3e7b3a6ee92 (""ice: preventNULL pointer deref during reload"") the driver has zeroed outnum_q_vectors, and only restored it in ice_vsi_cfg_def().This further causes the ice_rebuild() function to allocate a zero lengthbuffer, after which num_q_vectors is updated, and then the new value ofnum_q_vectors is used to index into the zero length buffer, whichcorrupts memory.The fix entails making sure all the code referencing num_q_vectors onlydoes so after it has been reset via ice_vsi_cfg_def().I didn't perform a full bisect, but I was able to test against 6.1.77kernel and that ice driver works fine for suspend/resume with no panic,so sometime since then, this problem was introduced.Also clean up an un-needed init of a local variable in the functionbeing modified.PANIC from 6.8.0-rc1:[1026674.915596] PM: suspend exit[1026675.664697] ice 0000:17:00.1: PTP reset successful[1026675.664707] ice 0000:17:00.1: 2755 msecs passed between update to cached PHC time[1026675.667660] ice 0000:b1:00.0: PTP reset successful[1026675.675944] ice 0000:b1:00.0: 2832 msecs passed between update to cached PHC time[1026677.137733] ixgbe 0000:31:00.0 ens787: NIC Link is Up 1 Gbps, Flow Control: None[1026677.190201] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010[1026677.192753] ice 0000:17:00.0: PTP reset successful[1026677.192764] ice 0000:17:00.0: 4548 msecs passed between update to cached PHC time[1026677.197928] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode[1026677.197933] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page[1026677.197937] PGD 1557a7067 P4D 0[1026677.212133] ice 0000:b1:00.1: PTP reset successful[1026677.212143] ice 0000:b1:00.1: 4344 msecs passed between update to cached PHC time[1026677.212575][1026677.243142] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI[1026677.247918] CPU: 23 PID: 42790 Comm: kworker/23:0 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G        W          6.8.0-rc1+ #1[1026677.257989] Hardware name: Intel Corporation M50CYP2SBSTD/M50CYP2SBSTD, BIOS SE5C620.86B.01.01.0005.2202160810 02/16/2022[1026677.269367] Workqueue: ice ice_service_task [ice][1026677.274592] RIP: 0010:ice_vsi_rebuild_set_coalesce+0x130/0x1e0 [ice][1026677.281421] Code: 0f 84 3a ff ff ff 41 0f b7 74 ec 02 66 89 b0 22 02 00 00 81 e6 ff 1f 00 00 e8 ec fd ff ff e9 35 ff ff ff 48 8b 43 30 49 63 ed <41> 0f b7 34 24 41 83 c5 01 48 8b 3c e8 66 89 b7 aa 02 00 00 81 e6[1026677.300877] RSP: 0018:ff3be62a6399bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010202[1026677.306556] RAX: ff28691e28980828 RBX: ff28691e41099828 RCX: 0000000000188000[1026677.314148] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000010 RDI: ff28691e41099828[1026677.321730] RBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: 0000000000000000[1026677.329311] R10: 0000000000000007 R11: ffffffffffffffc0 R12: 0000000000000010[1026677.336896] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: ff28691e0eaa81a0[1026677.344472] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ff28693cbffc0000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000[1026677.353000] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[1026677.359195] CR2: 0000000000000010 CR3: 0000000128df4001 CR4: 0000000000771ef0[1026677.366779] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000[1026677.374369] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400[1026677.381952] PKRU: 55555554[1026677.385116] Call Trace:[1026677.388023]  <TASK>[1026677.390589]  ? __die+0x20/0x70[1026677.394105]  ? page_fault_oops+0x82/0x160[1026677.398576]  ? do_user_addr_fault+0x65/0x6a0[1026677.403307]  ? exc_page_fault+0x6a/0x150[1026677.407694]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x30[1026677.412349]  ? ice_vsi_rebuild_set_coalesce+0x130/0x1e0 [ice][1026677.4186---truncated---",2024-05-20T13:00:04.957,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35911

It assumes that each devicehas a unique source ID. This assumption is incorrect and the VT-dspec doesn't state this requirement either.The reason for using a rbtree to track devices is to look up the devicewith PCI bus and devfunc in the paths of handling ATS invalidation timeout error and the PRI I/O page faults. Both are PCI ATS feature related.Only track the devices that have PCI ATS capabilities in the rbtree toavoid unnecessary WARN_ON in the iommu probe path. Otherwise, on someplatforms below kernel splat will be displayed and the iommu probe resultsin failure.

CVE-2024-4067,1.4,NPM,"The NPM package `micromatch` is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.",2024-05-22T12:15:10.767,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-4067

The memory itself of such item is not freed thanks to RCUbut nothing guarantees the actual content of the memory is sane.In particular, the reference count can be zero. This can happen ifipv6_del_addr is called in parallel. ipv6_del_addr removes the entryfrom inet6_addr_lst (hlist_del_init_rcu(&ifp->addr_lst)) and drops allreferences (__in6_ifa_put(ifp) + in6_ifa_put(ifp)).

CVE-2024-35873,NA,VS Code,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:riscv: Fix vector state restore in rt_sigreturn()The RISC-V Vector specification states in ""Appendix D: CallingConvention for Vector State"" [1] that ""Executing a system call causesall caller-saved vector registers (v0-v31, vl, vtype) and vstart tobecome unspecified."". In the RISC-V kernel this is called ""discardingthe vstate"".Returning from a signal handler via the rt_sigreturn() syscall, vectordiscard is also performed. However, this is not an issue since thevector state should be restored from the sigcontext, and therefore notcare about the vector discard.The ""live state"" is the actual vector register in the running context,and the ""vstate"" is the vector state of the task. A dirty live state,means that the vstate and live state are not in synch.When vectorized user_from_copy() was introduced, an bug sneaked in atthe restoration code, related to the discard of the live state.An example when this go wrong:  1. A userland application is executing vector code  2. The application receives a signal, and the signal handler is     entered.  3. The application returns from the signal handler, using the     rt_sigreturn() syscall.  4. The live vector state is discarded upon entering the     rt_sigreturn(), and the live state is marked as ""dirty"", indicating     that the live state need to be synchronized with the current     vstate.  5. rt_sigreturn() restores the vstate, except the Vector registers,     from the sigcontext  6. rt_sigreturn() restores the Vector registers, from the sigcontext,     and now the vectorized user_from_copy() is used. The dirty live     state from the discard is saved to the vstate, making the vstate     corrupt.  7. rt_sigreturn() returns to the application, which crashes due to     corrupted vstate.Note that the vectorized user_from_copy() is invoked depending on thevalue of CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_V_UCOPY_THRESHOLD. Default is 768, whichmeans that vlen has to be larger than 128b for this bug to trigger.The fix is simply to mark the live state as non-dirty/clean priorperforming the vstate restore.",2024-05-20T13:00:04.957,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-35873

CVE-2024-35875,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/coco: Require seeding RNG with RDRAND on CoCo systemsThere are few uses of CoCo that don't rely on working cryptography andhence a working RNG. Unfortunately, the CoCo threat model means that theVM host cannot be trusted and may actively work against guests toextract secrets or manipulate computation. Since a malicious host canmodify or observe nearly all inputs to guests, the only remaining sourceof entropy for CoCo guests is RDRAND.If RDRAND is broken -- due to CPU hardware fault -- the RNG as a wholeis meant to gracefully continue on gathering entropy from other sources,but since there aren't other sources on CoCo, this is catastrophic.This is mostly a concern at boot time when initially seeding the RNG, asafter that the consequences of a broken RDRAND are much moretheoretical.So, try at boot to seed the RNG using 256 bits of RDRAND output. If thisfails, panic(). This will also trigger if the system is booted withoutRDRAND, as RDRAND is essential for a safe CoCo boot.Add this deliberately to be ""just a CoCo x86 driver feature"" and notpart of the RNG itself. Many device drivers and platforms have somedesire to contribute something to the RNG, and add_device_randomness()is specifically meant for this purpose.Any driver can call it with seed data of any quality, or even garbagequality, and it can only possibly make the quality of the RNG better orhave no effect, but can never make it worse.Rather than trying to build something into the core of the RNG, considerthe particular CoCo issue just a CoCo issue, and therefore separate itall out into driver (well, arch/platform) code.

CVE-2024-35877,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/mm/pat: fix VM_PAT handling in COW mappingsPAT handling won't do the right thing in COW mappings: the first PTE (or,in fact, all PTEs) can be replaced during write faults to point at anonfolios.  Reliably recovering the correct PFN and cachemode usingfollow_phys() from PTEs will not work in COW mappings.Using follow_phys(), we might just get the address+protection of the anonfolio (which is very wrong), or fail on swap/nonswap entries, failingfollow_phys() and triggering a WARN_ON_ONCE() in untrack_pfn() andtrack_pfn_copy(), not properly calling free_pfn_range().In free_pfn_range(), we either wouldn't call memtype_free() or would callit with the wrong range, possibly leaking memory.To fix that, let's update follow_phys() to refuse returning anon folios,and fallback to using the stored PFN inside vma->vm_pgoff for COW mappingsif we run into that.We will now properly handle untrack_pfn() with COW mappings, where wedon't need the cachemode.  We'll have to fail fork()->track_pfn_copy() ifthe first page was replaced by an anon folio, though: we'd have to storethe cachemode in the VMA to make this work, likely growing the VMA size.For now, lets keep it simple and let track_pfn_copy() just fail in thatcase: it would have failed in the past with swap/nonswap entries already,and it would have done the wrong thing with anon folios.Simple reproducer to trigger the WARN_ON_ONCE() in untrack_pfn():<--- C reproducer ---> #include <stdio.h> #include <sys/mman.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <liburing.h> int main(void) {         struct io_uring_params p = {};         int ring_fd;         size_t size;         char *map;         ring_fd = io_uring_setup(1, &p);         if (ring_fd < 0) {                 perror(""io_uring_setup"");                 return 1;         }         size = p.sq_off.array + p.sq_entries * sizeof(unsigned);         /* Map the submission queue ring MAP_PRIVATE */         map = mmap(0, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE,                    ring_fd, IORING_OFF_SQ_RING);         if (map == MAP_FAILED) {                 perror(""mmap"");                 return 1;         }         /* We have at least one page.
