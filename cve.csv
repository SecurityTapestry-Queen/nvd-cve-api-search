CVE-2024-24814,3.6,Apache,"mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified™ authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2.

CVE-2021-46987,NA,IoT,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroupsThere are a few exceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs tocopy the inline extent data into a page of the destination inode.When this happens, we end up starting a transaction while having a dirtypage for the destination inode and while having the range locked in thedestination's inode iotree too. Because when reserving metadata spacefor a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case there isnot enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to prevent a deadlock,which was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d (""btrfs: fix deadlock whencloning inline extent and low on free metadata space"").However when using qgroups, a transaction also reserves metadata qgroupspace, which can also result in flushing delalloc in case there is notenough available space at the moment. When this happens we deadlock, sinceflushing delalloc requires locking the file range in the inode's iotreeand the range was already locked at the very beginning of the cloneoperation, before attempting to start the transaction.When this issue happens, stack traces like the following are reported:  [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9   state:D stack:    0 pid:  225 ppid:     2 flags:0x00004000  [72747.556268] Workqueue: writeback wb_workfn (flush-btrfs-1142)  [72747.556271] Call Trace:  [72747.556273]  __schedule+0x296/0x760  [72747.556277]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0  [72747.556279]  io_schedule+0x12/0x40  [72747.556284]  __lock_page+0x13c/0x280  [72747.556287]  ? generic_file_readonly_mmap+0x70/0x70  [72747.556325]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x22a/0x440 [btrfs]  [72747.556331]  ? __set_page_dirty_nobuffers+0xe7/0x160  [72747.556358]  ? set_extent_buffer_dirty+0x5e/0x80 [btrfs]  [72747.556362]  ? update_group_capacity+0x25/0x210  [72747.556366]  ? cpumask_next_and+0x1a/0x20  [72747.556391]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]  [72747.556394]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0  [72747.556398]  __writeback_single_inode+0x39/0x2a0  [72747.556403]  writeback_sb_inodes+0x1ea/0x440  [72747.556407]  __writeback_inodes_wb+0x5f/0xc0  [72747.556410]  wb_writeback+0x235/0x2b0  [72747.556414]  ? get_nr_inodes+0x35/0x50  [72747.556417]  wb_workfn+0x354/0x490  [72747.556420]  ? newidle_balance+0x2c5/0x3e0  [72747.556424]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340  [72747.556426]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390  [72747.556429]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0  [72747.556432]  kthread+0x116/0x130  [72747.556435]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80  [72747.556438]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30  [72747.566958] Workqueue: btrfs-flush_delalloc btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]  [72747.566961] Call Trace:  [72747.566964]  __schedule+0x296/0x760  [72747.566968]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80  [72747.566970]  schedule+0x3c/0xa0  [72747.566995]  wait_extent_bit.constprop.68+0x13b/0x1c0 [btrfs]  [72747.566999]  ? finish_wait+0x80/0x80  [72747.567024]  lock_extent_bits+0x37/0x90 [btrfs]  [72747.567047]  btrfs_invalidatepage+0x299/0x2c0 [btrfs]  [72747.567051]  ? find_get_pages_range_tag+0x2cd/0x380  [72747.567076]  __extent_writepage+0x203/0x320 [btrfs]  [72747.567102]  extent_write_cache_pages+0x2bb/0x440 [btrfs]  [72747.567106]  ? update_load_avg+0x7e/0x5f0  [72747.567109]  ? enqueue_entity+0xf4/0x6f0  [72747.567134]  extent_writepages+0x44/0xa0 [btrfs]  [72747.567137]  ? enqueue_task_fair+0x93/0x6f0  [72747.567140]  do_writepages+0x41/0xd0  [72747.567144]  __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xc7/0x100  [72747.567167]  btrfs_run_delalloc_work+0x17/0x40 [btrfs]  [72747.567195]  btrfs_work_helper+0xc2/0x300 [btrfs]  [72747.567200]  process_one_work+0x1aa/0x340  [72747.567202]  worker_thread+0x30/0x390  [72747.567205]  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0  [72747.567208]  kthread+0x116/0x130  [72747.567211]  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80  [72747.567214]  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30  [72747.569686] task:fsstress        state:D stack:    ---truncated---",2024-02-28T14:06:45.783,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-46987

CVE-2024-27093,2.5,Repository,"Minder is a Software Supply Chain Security Platform. In version 0.0.31 and earlier, it is possible for an attacker to register a repository with a invalid or differing upstream ID, which causes Minder to report the repository as registered, but not remediate any future changes which conflict with policy (because the webhooks for the repo do not match any known repository in the database).  When attempting to register a repo with a different repo ID, the registered provider must have admin on the named repo, or a 404 error will result.  Similarly, if the stored provider token does not have repo access, then the remediations will not apply successfully.  Lastly, it appears that reconciliation actions do not execute against repos with this type of mismatch. This appears to primarily be a potential denial-of-service vulnerability.

CVE-2023-52478,NA,VS Code,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnecthidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)races when it races with itself.hidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runson probe() and if a ""device-connected"" packet is received by the hwwhen the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting onthe hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will bestarted from the workqueue.This opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):	if (!hidpp->protocol_major) {		hidpp_root_get_protocol_version()		hidpp->protocol_major = response.rap.params[0];	}We can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt outputattached to rhbz#2227968:[ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.[ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.Testing with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threadstake turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pongthrough all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):	if (hidpp->name == hdev->name) {		...		hidpp->name = new_name;	}3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):hidpp_initialize_battery(){        if (hidpp->battery.ps)                return 0;	probe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);	hidpp->battery.ps =		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);}4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):	if (hidpp->delayed_input)		return;	hidpp->delayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);The really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the followingsequence:	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);	hidpp->battery.ps =		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);	...	hidpp->battery.desc.properties =		devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);	hidpp->battery.ps =		devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,					   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);So now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,which looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not eventhe really big problem.Notice how:1. This is all devm-maganaged2. The hidpp->battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies3. hidpp->battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second   devm_kmemdup()This causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,   hidpp->battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp->battery.desc.properties which   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08...Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_eventSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0...Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26/0x30Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee/0x1d0Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d/0x1d0Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f/0x2d0Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291/0x680Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ---truncated---",2024-02-29T13:49:29.390,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-52478

CVE-2021-46997,NA,Virtual Machine,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:arm64: entry: always set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during entryZenghui reports that booting a kernel with ""irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1""on the command line hits a warning during kernel entry, due to the waywe manipulate the PMR.Early in the entry sequence, we call lockdep_hardirqs_off() to informlockdep that interrupts have been masked (as the HW sets DAIF wqhenentering an exception). Architecturally PMR_EL1 is not affected byexception entry, and we don't set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR early inthe exception entry sequence, so early in exception entry the PMR canindicate that interrupts are unmasked even though they are masked byDAIF.If DEBUG_LOCKDEP is selected, lockdep_hardirqs_off() will check thatinterrupts are masked, before we set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in any of theexception entry paths, and hence lockdep_hardirqs_off() will WARN() thatsomething is amiss.We can avoid this by consistently setting GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET duringexception entry so that kernel code sees a consistent environment. Wemust also update local_daif_inherit() to undo this, as currently onlytouches DAIF. For other paths, local_daif_restore() will update bothDAIF and the PMR. With this done, we can remove the existing specialcases which set this later in the entry code.We always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET) for consistency withlocal_daif_save(), as this will warn if it ever encounters(GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), and never sets this itself.
