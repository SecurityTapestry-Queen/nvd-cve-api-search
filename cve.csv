CVE-2024-23825,1.4,AWS,"TablePress is a table plugin for Wordpress. For importing tables, TablePress makes external HTTP requests based on a URL that is provided by the user. That user input is filtered insufficiently, which makes it is possible to send requests to unintended network locations and receive responses. On sites in a cloud environment like AWS, an attacker can potentially make GET requests to the instance's metadata REST API. If the instance's configuration is insecure, this can lead to the exposure of internal data, including credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.5.",2024-01-30T20:48:58.267,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-23825

When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and for each which contains a file, it is extracted and saved in `/tmp` with a random filename starting with `bref_upload_`. The flow mimics what plain PHP does but it does not delete the temporary files when the request has been processed.

CVE-2024-22424,6.0,CSRF,"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. The Argo CD API prior to versions 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15 are vulnerable to a cross-server request forgery (CSRF) attack when the attacker has the ability to write HTML to a page on the same parent domain as Argo CD. A CSRF attack works by tricking an authenticated Argo CD user into loading a web page which contains code to call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim’s behalf. For example, an attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a page which looks harmless but in the background calls an Argo CD API endpoint to create an application running malicious code. Argo CD uses the “Lax” SameSite cookie policy to prevent CSRF attacks where the attacker controls an external domain. The malicious external website can attempt to call the Argo CD API, but the web browser will refuse to send the Argo CD auth token with the request. Many companies host Argo CD on an internal subdomain. If an attacker can place malicious code on, for example, https://test.internal.example.com/, they can still perform a CSRF attack. In this case, the “Lax” SameSite cookie does not prevent the browser from sending the auth cookie, because the destination is a parent domain of the Argo CD API. Browsers generally block such attacks by applying CORS policies to sensitive requests with sensitive content types. Specifically, browsers will send a “preflight request” for POSTs with content type “application/json” asking the destination API “are you allowed to accept requests from my domain?” If the destination API does not answer “yes,” the browser will block the request. Before the patched versions, Argo CD did not validate that requests contained the correct content type header. So an attacker could bypass the browser’s CORS check by setting the content type to something which is considered “not sensitive” such as “text/plain.” The browser wouldn’t send the preflight request, and Argo CD would happily accept the contents (which are actually still JSON) and perform the requested action (such as running malicious code). A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15. The patch contains a breaking API change. The Argo CD API will no longer accept non-GET requests which do not specify application/json as their Content-Type. The accepted content types list is configurable, and it is possible (but discouraged) to disable the content type check completely. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2023-47115,2.7,Django,"Label Studio is an a popular open source data labeling tool. Versions prior to 1.9.2 have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited when an authenticated user uploads a crafted image file for their avatar that gets rendered as a HTML file on the website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.The file `users/functions.py` lines 18-49 show that the only verification check is that the file is an image by extracting the dimensions from the file. Label Studio serves avatar images using Django's built-in `serve` view, which is not secure for production use according to Django's documentation. The issue with the Django `serve` view is that it determines the `Content-Type` of the response by the file extension in the URL path. Therefore, an attacker can upload an image that contains malicious HTML code and name the file with a `.html` extension to be rendered as a HTML page. The only file extension validation is performed on the client-side, which can be easily bypassed.Version 1.9.2 fixes this issue. Other remediation strategies include validating the file extension on the server side, not in client-side code; removing the use of Django's `serve` view and implement a secure controller for viewing uploaded avatar images; saving file content in the database rather than on the filesystem to mitigate against other file related vulnerabilities; and avoiding trusting user controlled inputs.",2024-02-01T15:48:10.727,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-47115
CVE-2024-23633,2.7,Django,"Label Studio, an open source data labeling tool had a remote import feature allowed users to import data from a remote web source, that was downloaded and could be viewed on the website. Prior to version 1.10.1, this feature could had been abused to download a HTML file that executed malicious JavaScript code in the context of the Label Studio website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.`data_import/uploader.py` lines 125C5 through 146 showed that if a URL passed the server side request forgery verification checks, the contents of the file would be downloaded using the filename in the URL. The downloaded file path could then be retrieved by sending a request to `/api/projects/{project_id}/file-uploads?ids=[{download_id}]` where `{project_id}` was the ID of the project and `{download_id}` was the ID of the downloaded file. Once the downloaded file path was retrieved by the previous API endpoint, `data_import/api.py`lines 595C1 through 616C62 demonstrated that the `Content-Type` of the response was determined by the file extension, since `mimetypes.guess_type` guesses the `Content-Type` based on the file extension. Since the `Content-Type` was determined by the file extension of the downloaded file, an attacker could import in a `.html` file that would execute JavaScript when visited.Version 1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue. Other remediation strategies are also available. For all user provided files that are downloaded by Label Studio, set the `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox;` response header when viewed on the site. The `sandbox` directive restricts a page's actions to prevent popups, execution of plugins and scripts and enforces a `same-origin` policy.

CVE-2022-24769,3.4,Docker,"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.

CVE-2024-22419,5.9,Ethereum,"Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The buffer overflow can result in the change of semantics of the contract. The overflow is length-dependent and thus it might go unnoticed during contract testing. However, certainly not all usages of concat will result in overwritten valid data as we require it to be in an internal function and close to the return statement where other memory allocations don't occur.

The Argo CD API prior to versions 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15 are vulnerable to a cross-server request forgery (CSRF) attack when the attacker has the ability to write HTML to a page on the same parent domain as Argo CD. A CSRF attack works by tricking an authenticated Argo CD user into loading a web page which contains code to call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim’s behalf. For example, an attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a page which looks harmless but in the background calls an Argo CD API endpoint to create an application running malicious code. Argo CD uses the “Lax” SameSite cookie policy to prevent CSRF attacks where the attacker controls an external domain. The malicious external website can attempt to call the Argo CD API, but the web browser will refuse to send the Argo CD auth token with the request. Many companies host Argo CD on an internal subdomain. If an attacker can place malicious code on, for example, https://test.internal.example.com/, they can still perform a CSRF attack. In this case, the “Lax” SameSite cookie does not prevent the browser from sending the auth cookie, because the destination is a parent domain of the Argo CD API. Browsers generally block such attacks by applying CORS policies to sensitive requests with sensitive content types. Specifically, browsers will send a “preflight request” for POSTs with content type “application/json” asking the destination API “are you allowed to accept requests from my domain?” If the destination API does not answer “yes,” the browser will block the request. Before the patched versions, Argo CD did not validate that requests contained the correct content type header. So an attacker could bypass the browser’s CORS check by setting the content type to something which is considered “not sensitive” such as “text/plain.” The browser wouldn’t send the preflight request, and Argo CD would happily accept the contents (which are actually still JSON) and perform the requested action (such as running malicious code). A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15. The patch contains a breaking API change. The Argo CD API will no longer accept non-GET requests which do not specify application/json as their Content-Type. The accepted content types list is configurable, and it is possible (but discouraged) to disable the content type check completely. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",2024-01-31T19:51:26.407,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-22424

On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin ""Text"". The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. Another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on ""Markdown"" or ""HTML"" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.

CVE-2024-21585,3.6,Juniper,"An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in BGP session processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker, using specific timing outside the attacker's control, to flap BGP sessions and cause the routing protocol daemon (rpd) process to crash and restart, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued BGP session flapping will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue only affects routers configured with non-stop routing (NSR) enabled. Graceful Restart (GR) helper mode, enabled by default, is also required for this issue to be exploitable.Note: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.When the BGP session flaps on the NSR-enabled router, the device enters GR-helper/LLGR-helper mode due to the peer having negotiated GR/LLGR-restarter capability and the backup BGP requests for replication of the GR/LLGR-helper session, master BGP schedules, and initiates replication of GR/LLGR stale routes to the backup BGP. In this state, if the BGP session with the BGP peer comes up again, unsolicited replication is initiated for the peer without cleaning up the ongoing GR/LLGR-helper mode replication. This parallel two instances of replication for the same peer leads to the assert if the BGP session flaps again.This issue affects:Juniper Networks Junos OS  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S9;  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5;  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S1;  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3;  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1, 23.2R2.Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved  *  All versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5-EVO;  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5-EVO;  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4-EVO;  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3-EVO;  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S1-EVO;  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-S2-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO;  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.",2024-01-31T00:15:45.920,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-21585

CVE-2024-22424,6.0,Kubernetes,"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. The Argo CD API prior to versions 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15 are vulnerable to a cross-server request forgery (CSRF) attack when the attacker has the ability to write HTML to a page on the same parent domain as Argo CD. A CSRF attack works by tricking an authenticated Argo CD user into loading a web page which contains code to call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim’s behalf. For example, an attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a page which looks harmless but in the background calls an Argo CD API endpoint to create an application running malicious code. Argo CD uses the “Lax” SameSite cookie policy to prevent CSRF attacks where the attacker controls an external domain. The malicious external website can attempt to call the Argo CD API, but the web browser will refuse to send the Argo CD auth token with the request. Many companies host Argo CD on an internal subdomain. If an attacker can place malicious code on, for example, https://test.internal.example.com/, they can still perform a CSRF attack. In this case, the “Lax” SameSite cookie does not prevent the browser from sending the auth cookie, because the destination is a parent domain of the Argo CD API. Browsers generally block such attacks by applying CORS policies to sensitive requests with sensitive content types. Specifically, browsers will send a “preflight request” for POSTs with content type “application/json” asking the destination API “are you allowed to accept requests from my domain?” If the destination API does not answer “yes,” the browser will block the request. Before the patched versions, Argo CD did not validate that requests contained the correct content type header. So an attacker could bypass the browser’s CORS check by setting the content type to something which is considered “not sensitive” such as “text/plain.” The browser wouldn’t send the preflight request, and Argo CD would happily accept the contents (which are actually still JSON) and perform the requested action (such as running malicious code). A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions: 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15. The patch contains a breaking API change. The Argo CD API will no longer accept non-GET requests which do not specify application/json as their Content-Type. The accepted content types list is configurable, and it is possible (but discouraged) to disable the content type check completely. Users are advised to upgrade.

CVE-2024-22403,1.4,OAuth,Nextcloud server is a self hosted personal cloud system. In affected versions OAuth codes did not expire. When an attacker would get access to an authorization code they could authenticate at any time using the code. As of version 28.0.0 OAuth codes are invalidated after 10 minutes and will no longer be authenticated. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to intercept an OAuth code from a user session. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.0.

CVE-2023-5363,3.6,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key andinitialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncationor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() orEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed afterthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,via the ""keylen"" parameter or the IV length, via the ""ivlen"" parameter,within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentiallycausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphersand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result inloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38Dsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES inGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV willproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memoryexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as securitycritical.Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operationand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely thatapplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing sincedecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarlyvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application beingvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable thenthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed thisissue as Moderate severity overall.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this becausethe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.",2024-02-01T17:15:08.743,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-5363

CVE-2023-5363,3.6,SSL,"Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key andinitialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncationor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,which could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() orEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed afterthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,via the ""keylen"" parameter or the IV length, via the ""ivlen"" parameter,within the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentiallycausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphersand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.For the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result inloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38Dsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES inGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.Both truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV willproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memoryexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as securitycritical.Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operationand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely thatapplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing sincedecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarlyvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application beingvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable thenthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed thisissue as Moderate severity overall.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this becausethe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.OpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.",2024-02-01T17:15:08.743,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-5363

CVE-2024-22419,5.9,Virtual Machine,"Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The `concat` built-in can write over the bounds of the memory buffer that was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid data. The root cause is that the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't properly adhere to the API of copy functions (for `>=0.3.2` the `copy_bytes` function). A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The buffer overflow can result in the change of semantics of the contract. The overflow is length-dependent and thus it might go unnoticed during contract testing. However, certainly not all usages of concat will result in overwritten valid data as we require it to be in an internal function and close to the return statement where other memory allocations don't occur. This issue has been addressed in commit `55e18f6d1` which will be included in future releases. Users are advised to update when possible.",2024-01-26T18:10:24.747,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-22419

Vyper compiler allows passing a value in builtin raw_call even if the call is a delegatecall or a staticcall. But in the context of delegatecall and staticcall the handling of value is not possible due to the semantics of the respective opcodes, and vyper will silently ignore the value= argument. If the semantics of the EVM are unknown to the developer, he could suspect that by specifying the `value` kwarg, exactly the given amount will be sent along to the target.
