CVE-2007-6420,2.9,Apache,Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the balancer-manager in mod_proxy_balancer for Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x allows remote attackers to gain privileges via unspecified vectors.,2024-04-26T16:08:29.987,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2007-6420
CVE-2023-48795,3.6,Apache,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

CVE-2024-32656,5.9,Apache,"Ant Media Server is live streaming engine software. A local privilege escalation vulnerability in present in versions 2.6.0 through 2.8.2 allows any unprivileged operating system user account to escalate privileges to the root user account on the system. This vulnerability arises from Ant Media Server running with Java Management Extensions (JMX) enabled and authentication disabled on localhost on port 5599/TCP. This vulnerability is nearly identical to the local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-26269 identified in Apache James. Any unprivileged operating system user can connect to the JMX service running on port 5599/TCP on localhost and leverage the MLet Bean within JMX to load a remote MBean from an attacker-controlled server. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Java process run by Ant Media Server and execute code within the context of the `antmedia` service account on the system. Version 2.9.0 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may remove certain parameters from the `antmedia.service` file.",2024-04-23T12:52:26.253,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-32656

CVE-2022-48644,NA,Atom,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net/sched: taprio: avoid disabling offload when it was never enabledIn an incredibly strange API design decision, qdisc->destroy() getscalled even if qdisc->init() never succeeded, not exclusively sincecommit 87b60cfacf9f (""net_sched: fix error recovery at qdisc creation""),but apparently also earlier (in the case of qdisc_create_dflt()).The taprio qdisc does not fully acknowledge this when it attempts fulloffload, because it starts off with q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID intaprio_init(), then it replaces q->flags with TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_FLAGSparsed from netlink (in taprio_change(), tail called from taprio_init()).But in taprio_destroy(), we call taprio_disable_offload(), and thisdetermines what to do based on FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED(q->flags).But looking at the implementation of FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED()(a bitwise check of bit 1 in q->flags), it is invalid to call this macroon q->flags when it contains TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, because that is setto U32_MAX, and therefore FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED() will return true onan invalid set of flags.As a result, it is possible to crash the kernel if user space forces anerror between setting q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, and the callingof taprio_enable_offload(). This is because drivers do not expect theoffload to be disabled when it was never enabled.The error that we force here is to attach taprio as a non-root qdisc,but instead as child of an mqprio root qdisc:$ tc qdisc add dev swp0 root handle 1: \	mqprio num_tc 8 map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \	queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 hw 0$ tc qdisc replace dev swp0 parent 1:1 \	taprio num_tc 8 map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \	queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 base-time 0 \	sched-entry S 0x7f 990000 sched-entry S 0x80 100000 \	flags 0x0 clockid CLOCK_TAIUnable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address fffffffffffffff8[fffffffffffffff8] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMPCall trace: taprio_dump+0x27c/0x310 vsc9959_port_setup_tc+0x1f4/0x460 felix_port_setup_tc+0x24/0x3c dsa_slave_setup_tc+0x54/0x27c taprio_disable_offload.isra.0+0x58/0xe0 taprio_destroy+0x80/0x104 qdisc_create+0x240/0x470 tc_modify_qdisc+0x1fc/0x6b0 rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x12c/0x390 netlink_rcv_skb+0x5c/0x130 rtnetlink_rcv+0x1c/0x2cFix this by keeping track of the operations we made, and undo theoffload only if we actually did it.I've added ""bool offloaded"" inside a 4 byte hole between ""int clockid""and ""atomic64_t picos_per_byte"".

Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.",2024-04-25T17:24:59.967,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-32481

CVE-2022-40735,3.6,Exploit,"The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that ""(appropriately) short exponents"" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001 together.",2024-04-23T07:15:42.550,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-40735

CVE-2023-45288,NA,Endpoint,"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.",2024-04-25T06:15:52.357,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-45288

CVE-2023-39325,3.6,Golang,"A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.",2024-04-28T04:15:09.877,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-39325
CVE-2023-48795,3.6,Golang,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

NOTE: some parties have mapped the recursive Reflection API issue to CVE-2012-3174, but CVE-2012-3174 is for a different vulnerability whose details are not public as of 20130114.  CVE-2013-0422 covers both the JMX/MBean and Reflection API issues.  NOTE: it was originally reported that Java 6 was also vulnerable, but the reporter has retracted this claim, stating that Java 6 is not exploitable because the relevant code is called in a way that does not bypass security checks.  NOTE: as of 20130114, a reliable third party has claimed that the findClass/MBeanInstantiator vector was not fixed in Oracle Java 7 Update 11.

CVE-2023-6129,4.2,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementationcontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications runningon PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MACalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with variousapplication dependent consequences.The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL forPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different orderthan they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registersare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies thatTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. Howeverwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affectedby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.",2024-04-26T09:15:08.910,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-6129
CVE-2023-6237,NA,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may takea long time.Impact summary: Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check()to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key thatis being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may leadto a Denial of Service.When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys,a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite.For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and thiscomputation completes quickly.

CVE-2024-32481,1.4,Python,"Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.",2024-04-25T17:24:59.967,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-32481

CVE-2023-48795,3.6,SSH,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

CVE-2024-31497,NA,SSH,"In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git.

CVE-2023-6129,4.2,TLS,"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementationcontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications runningon PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MACalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with variousapplication dependent consequences.The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL forPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different orderthan they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registersare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used.

CVE-2024-32481,1.4,Virtual Machine,"Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.",2024-04-25T17:24:59.967,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-32481

CVE-2023-4759,5.9,Windows,"Arbitrary File Overwrite in Eclipse JGit <= 6.6.0In Eclipse JGit, all versions <= 6.6.0.202305301015-r, a symbolic link present in a specially crafted git repository can be used to write a file to locations outside the working tree when this repository is cloned with JGit to a case-insensitive filesystem, or when a checkout from a clone of such a repository is performed on a case-insensitive filesystem.This can happen on checkout (DirCacheCheckout), merge (ResolveMerger via its WorkingTreeUpdater), pull (PullCommand using merge), and when applying a patch (PatchApplier). This can be exploited for remote code execution (RCE), for instance if the file written outside the working tree is a git filter that gets executed on a subsequent git command.The issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The user performing the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git configuration.Setting git configuration option core.symlinks = false before checking out avoids the problem.The issue was fixed in Eclipse JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via  Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/  and  repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ . A backport is available in 5.13.3 starting from  5.13.3.202401111512-r.The JGit maintainers would like to thank RyotaK for finding and reporting this issue.",2024-04-26T16:09:44.783,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-4759

However, this requiresthat we do not remove the context from the list until after we drop thefinal reference and release the struct.
