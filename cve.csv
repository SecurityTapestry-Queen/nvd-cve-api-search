The graphapi app relies on a third-party GetPhpInfo.php library that provides a URL. When this URL is accessed, it reveals the configuration details of the PHP environment (phpinfo). This information includes all the environment variables of the webserver. In containerized deployments, these environment variables may include sensitive data such as the ownCloud admin password, mail server credentials, and license key. Simply disabling the graphapi app does not eliminate the vulnerability. Additionally, phpinfo exposes various other potentially sensitive configuration details that could be exploited by an attacker to gather information about the system. Therefore, even if ownCloud is not running in a containerized environment, this vulnerability should still be a cause for concern.

CVE-2023-36478,3.6,Eclipse,"Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values toexceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295will overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53.

You are affected if you are using an algorithm and a key type other than a combination listed in the GitHub Security Advisory as unaffected. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0. This version validates for asymmetric key type and algorithm combinations. Please refer to the above mentioned algorithm / key type combinations for the valid secure configuration. After updating to version 9.0.0, if you still intend to continue with signing or verifying tokens using invalid key type/algorithm value combinations, you’ll need to set the `allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option  to `true` in the `sign()` and/or `verify()` functions.",2024-06-21T19:15:22.683,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-23539

The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the ""return nil, nil, fail(...)"" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.",2024-06-27T05:15:50.317,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-1394

CVE-2023-52497,NA,Intel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompressionCurrently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplacedecompression, that was used to handle the cases that some pages ofcompressed data are actually not in-place I/O.However, like most simple LZ77 algorithms, LZ4 expects the compresseddata is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and itexplicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:  __________________________________________________________ |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this, it typically maps twoindividual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain.Previously, it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() forshort overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem tocompletely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reportedthat EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor.After some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors with the newFSRM feature expose this issue with ""rep movsb"".Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplacedecompression for now.

CVE-2020-1971,3.6,NULL Pointer,"The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the ""-crl_download"" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources.

CVE-2019-1547,3.6,OpenSSL,"Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation.

CVE-2021-23839,1.4,OpenSSL,"OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version.

CVE-2021-28363,2.5,Python,The urllib3 library 1.26.x before 1.26.4 for Python omits SSL certificate validation in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies. The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.,2024-06-21T19:15:17.763,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-28363

CVE-2024-35969,NA,Python,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:ipv6: fix race condition between ipv6_get_ifaddr and ipv6_del_addrAlthough ipv6_get_ifaddr walks inet6_addr_lst under the RCU lock, itstill means hlist_for_each_entry_rcu can return an item that got removedfrom the list. The memory itself of such item is not freed thanks to RCUbut nothing guarantees the actual content of the memory is sane.In particular, the reference count can be zero. This can happen ifipv6_del_addr is called in parallel. ipv6_del_addr removes the entryfrom inet6_addr_lst (hlist_del_init_rcu(&ifp->addr_lst)) and drops allreferences (__in6_ifa_put(ifp) + in6_ifa_put(ifp)).

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloningwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files.

CVE-2021-23839,1.4,SSL,"OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

No   attempt will be made to access ->usage after this as the   SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared thus valid_section() return false.Thanks to David/Pavan for their inputs on this patch.[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/994410bb-89aa-d987-1f50-f514903c55aa@quicinc.com/On Snapdragon SoC, with the mentioned memory configuration of PFN's as[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL], we are able to see bunch ofissues daily while testing on a device farm.For this particular issue below is the log.

CVE-2019-14861,3.6,Samba,"All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the (poorly named) dnsserver RPC pipe provides administrative facilities to modify DNS records and zones. Samba, when acting as an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP. In AD, the default permissions on the DNS partition allow creation of new records by authenticated users. This is used for example to allow machines to self-register in DNS. If a DNS record was created that case-insensitively matched the name of the zone, the ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare() routines could be confused into reading memory prior to the list of DNS entries when responding to DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() and so following invalid memory as a pointer.",2024-06-25T02:15:09.860,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-14861

CVE-2021-23839,1.4,TLS,"OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).",2024-06-21T19:15:16.830,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-23839
CVE-2021-3449,3.6,TLS,"An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client.

And that in turn fixes the moduleunloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU referenceuntil the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts thelast reference to the KVM module.Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item offthe completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as thework will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waitingon the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for thework to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a verysmall delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes anew request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so theremaining work is really just:        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);        mmput(mm);and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU isstill alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with ""wakeup all""work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in aworkqueue.

CVE-2024-26897,NA,WMI,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:wifi: ath9k: delay all of ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() until init is completeThe ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() used in ath9k_htc assumes that all the datastructures have been fully initialised by the time it runs. However, because ofthe order in which things are initialised, this is not guaranteed to be thecase, because the device is exposed to the USB subsystem before the ath9k driverinitialisation is completed.We already committed a partial fix for this in commit:8b3046abc99e (""ath9k_htc: fix NULL pointer dereference at ath9k_htc_tx_get_packet()"")However, that commit only aborted the WMI_TXSTATUS_EVENTID command in the eventtasklet, pairing it with an ""initialisation complete"" bit in the TX struct. Itseems syzbot managed to trigger the race for one of the other commands as well,so let's just move the existing synchronisation bit to cover the wholetasklet (setting it at the end of ath9k_htc_probe_device() instead of insideath9k_tx_init()).",2024-06-25T23:15:27.180,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26897

CVE-2024-26687,NA,Xen,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanupshutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking theirq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Bothare called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.This opens multiple races:- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event  channel:  CPU0                        CPU1  shutdown_pirq {    xen_evtchn_close(e)                              __startup_pirq {                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)                              }    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)    }  }  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel  number.  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.The fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the eventchannel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it'spotential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the eventchannel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMedevices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irqis called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race duringboot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq andstartup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.  ------------[ cut here ]------------  blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush: disabled; persistent grants: enabled; indirect descriptors: enabled; bounce buffer: enabled  kernel BUG at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:499!  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI  CPU: 44 PID: 375 Comm: kworker/u257:23 Not tainted 5.10.201-191.748.amzn2.x86_64 #1  Hardware name: Xen HVM domU, BIOS 4.11.amazon 08/24/2006  Workqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work  RIP: 0010:bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0  Code: 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc 44 89 f7 e8 2b 55 ad ff 49 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 64 ff ff ff 4c 8b 68 30 41 83 fe ff 0f 85 60 ff ff ff <0f> 0b 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 0f 1f 44 00 00  RSP: 0000:ffffc9000d533b08 EFLAGS: 00010046  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000006  RDX: 0000000000000028 RSI: 00000000ffffffff RDI: 00000000ffffffff  RBP: ffff888107419680 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffffff82d72b00  R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 00000000000001ed  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00000000ffffffff R15: 0000000000000002  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88bc8b500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000002610001 CR4: 00000000001706e0  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400  Call Trace:   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? set_affinity_irq+0xdc/0x1c0   ? __die_body.cold+0x8/0xd   ? die+0x2b/0x50   ? do_trap+0x90/0x110   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x12/0x20   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0x---truncated---",2024-06-25T22:15:20.917,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26687

CVE-2023-52497,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompressionCurrently EROFS can map another compressed buffer for inplacedecompression, that was used to handle the cases that some pages ofcompressed data are actually not in-place I/O.However, like most simple LZ77 algorithms, LZ4 expects the compresseddata is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and itexplicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:  __________________________________________________________ |_ direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _|Although EROFS arranges compressed data like this, it typically maps twoindividual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain.Previously, it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() forshort overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem tocompletely cover it up and they don't have this issue.  Juhyung reportedthat EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86 processor.After some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors with the newFSRM feature expose this issue with ""rep movsb"".Let's strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplacedecompression for now.
