CVE-2023-48795,3.6,Apache,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

The user performing the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git configuration.Setting git configuration option core.symlinks = false before checking out avoids the problem.The issue was fixed in Eclipse JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via  Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/  and  repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ .

CVE-2024-32481,1.4,Ethereum,"Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.",2024-04-25T17:24:59.967,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-32481

CVE-2013-0422,10.0,Exploit,"Multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle Java 7 before Update 11 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by (1) using the public getMBeanInstantiator method in the JmxMBeanServer class to obtain a reference to a private MBeanInstantiator object, then retrieving arbitrary Class references using the findClass method, and (2) using the Reflection API with recursion in a way that bypasses a security check by the java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.checkSecurityManager method due to the inability of the sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass method to skip frames related to the new reflection API, as exploited in the wild in January 2013, as demonstrated by Blackhole and Nuclear Pack, and a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4681 and CVE-2012-3174.

CVE-2013-0422 covers both the JMX/MBean and Reflection API issues.  NOTE: it was originally reported that Java 6 was also vulnerable, but the reporter has retracted this claim, stating that Java 6 is not exploitable because the relevant code is called in a way that does not bypass security checks.

CVE-2022-40735,3.6,Exploit,"The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that ""(appropriately) short exponents"" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations.

CVE-2023-48795,3.6,Golang,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC).

CVE-2023-6129,4.2,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementationcontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications runningon PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MACalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with variousapplication dependent consequences.The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL forPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different orderthan they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registersare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies thatTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted.

Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.",2024-04-25T17:24:59.967,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-32481

CVE-2023-48795,3.6,SSH,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

CVE-2024-31497,NA,SSH,"In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.",2024-04-26T02:15:06.197,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-31497

CVE-2023-6129,4.2,TLS,"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementationcontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications runningon PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MACalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with variousapplication dependent consequences.The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL forPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different orderthan they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registersare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies thatTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted.

Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected.
