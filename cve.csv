CVE-2020-1570,5.9,Office,"A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.",2024-04-16T19:22:42.250,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-1570

So, we set theDMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspacetools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.------------[ cut here ]------------kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:56!invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMPCPU: 1 PID: 8343 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.8.0-rc6 #4Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:__list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0<snip>RSP: 0018:ffff8881b831bcc0 EFLAGS: 00010282RAX: 000000000000004e RBX: ffff888143b6eb80 RCX: 0000000000000000RDX: 0000000000000001 RSI: ffffffff819053d0 RDI: 00000000ffffffffRBP: ffff8881b83a3400 R08: 00000000fffeffff R09: 0000000000000058R10: 0000000000000000 R11: ffffffff81a24080 R12: 0000000000000001R13: ffff88814538e000 R14: ffff888143bc6dc0 R15: ffffffffa02e4bb0FS:  00000000f7c0f780(0000) GS:ffff8893f0a40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000CS:  0010 DS: 002b ES: 002b CR0: 0000000080050033CR2: 0000000057fb5000 CR3: 0000000143474000 CR4: 00000000000006b0Call Trace: <TASK> ? die+0x2d/0x80 ? do_trap+0xeb/0xf0 ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? do_error_trap+0x60/0x80 ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? exc_invalid_op+0x49/0x60 ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20 ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod] ? __list_del_entry_valid_or_report+0x77/0xc0 origin_postsuspend+0x1a/0x50 [dm_snapshot] dm_table_postsuspend_targets+0x34/0x50 [dm_mod] dm_suspend+0xd8/0xf0 [dm_mod] dev_suspend+0x1f2/0x2f0 [dm_mod] ? table_deps+0x1b0/0x1b0 [dm_mod] ctl_ioctl+0x300/0x5f0 [dm_mod] dm_compat_ctl_ioctl+0x7/0x10 [dm_mod] __x64_compat_sys_ioctl+0x104/0x170 do_syscall_64+0x184/0x1b0 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0x4eRIP: 0033:0xf7e6aead<snip>---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---",2024-04-17T12:48:07.510,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26880

CVE-2024-29902,3.6,Redis,"Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer. Version 2.2.4 contains a patch for the vulnerability.",2024-04-11T12:47:44.137,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-29902

CVE-2024-31497,NA,SSH,"In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.",2024-04-16T23:15:08.903,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-31497

CVE-2024-26687,NA,Xen,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanupshutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking theirq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Bothare called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.This opens multiple races:- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event  channel:  CPU0                        CPU1  shutdown_pirq {    xen_evtchn_close(e)                              __startup_pirq {                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)                              }    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)    }  }  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel  number.  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.The fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the eventchannel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it'spotential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the eventchannel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMedevices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irqis called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race duringboot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq andstartup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.  ------------[ cut here ]------------  blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush: disabled; persistent grants: enabled; indirect descriptors: enabled; bounce buffer: enabled  kernel BUG at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:499!  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI  CPU: 44 PID: 375 Comm: kworker/u257:23 Not tainted 5.10.201-191.748.amzn2.x86_64 #1  Hardware name: Xen HVM domU, BIOS 4.11.amazon 08/24/2006  Workqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work  RIP: 0010:bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0  Code: 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc 44 89 f7 e8 2b 55 ad ff 49 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 64 ff ff ff 4c 8b 68 30 41 83 fe ff 0f 85 60 ff ff ff <0f> 0b 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 0f 1f 44 00 00  RSP: 0000:ffffc9000d533b08 EFLAGS: 00010046  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000006  RDX: 0000000000000028 RSI: 00000000ffffffff RDI: 00000000ffffffff  RBP: ffff888107419680 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffffff82d72b00  R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 00000000000001ed  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00000000ffffffff R15: 0000000000000002  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88bc8b500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000002610001 CR4: 00000000001706e0  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400  Call Trace:   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? set_affinity_irq+0xdc/0x1c0   ? __die_body.cold+0x8/0xd   ? die+0x2b/0x50   ? do_trap+0x90/0x110   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x12/0x20   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0x---truncated---",2024-04-13T12:15:11.463,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26687

This results in thefix-up setup by bpf not being applied and a page_fault_oops() is invokeddue to SMAP.Considering handle_page_fault() has already considered the vsyscall pageaddress as a userspace address, fix the problem by disallowing vsyscallpage read for copy_from_kernel_nofault().",2024-04-17T12:48:07.510,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26906
