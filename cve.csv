CVE-2024-29735,NA,Airflow,"Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories",2024-03-27T12:29:41.530,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-29735

CVE-2024-29735,NA,Docker,"Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories",2024-03-27T12:29:41.530,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-29735

CVE-2024-26646,NA,Intel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PMThe kernel allocates a memory buffer and provides its location to thehardware, which uses it to update the HFI table. This allocation occursduring boot and remains constant throughout runtime.When resuming from hibernation, the restore kernel allocates a secondmemory buffer and reprograms the HFI hardware with the new location aspart of a normal boot. The location of the second memory buffer maydiffer from the one allocated by the image kernel.When the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFIbuffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if thehardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from therestore kernel).It is also possible that the hardware ""forgets"" the address of the memorybuffer when resuming from ""deep"" suspend. Memory corruption may also occurin such a scenario.To prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing tosuspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.Add syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages ofnon-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on theboot CPU. Additionally, HFI only needs to be disabled during ""deep"" suspendand hibernation. Syscore ops only run in these cases.[ rjw: Comment adjustment, subject and changelog edits ]",2024-03-27T12:29:41.530,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26646

In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery.

CVE-2021-47136,NA,QEMU,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:net: zero-initialize tc skb extension on allocationFunction skb_ext_add() doesn't initialize created skb extension with anyvalue and leaves it up to the user. However, since extension of typeTC_SKB_EXT originally contained only single value tc_skb_ext->chain itsusers used to just assign the chain value without setting whole extensionmemory to zero first. This assumption changed when TC_SKB_EXT extension wasextended with additional fields but not all users were updated toinitialize the new fields which leads to use of uninitialized memoryafterwards.

CVE-2021-47169,NA,QEMU,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:serial: rp2: use 'request_firmware' instead of 'request_firmware_nowait'In 'rp2_probe', the driver registers 'rp2_uart_interrupt' then calls'rp2_fw_cb' through 'request_firmware_nowait'. In 'rp2_fw_cb', if thefirmware don't exists, function just return without initializing portsof 'rp2_card'. But now the interrupt handler function has beenregistered, and when an interrupt comes, 'rp2_uart_interrupt' may accessthose ports then causing NULL pointer dereference or other bugs.Because the driver does some initialization work in 'rp2_fw_cb', inorder to make the driver ready to handle interrupts, 'request_firmware'should be used instead of asynchronous 'request_firmware_nowait'.This report reveals it:INFO: trying to register non-static key.the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.turning off the locking correctness validator.CPU: 2 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/2 Not tainted 4.19.177-gdba4159c14ef-dirty #45Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.12.0-59-gc9ba5276e321-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014Call Trace: <IRQ> __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:77 [inline] dump_stack+0xec/0x156 lib/dump_stack.c:118 assign_lock_key kernel/locking/lockdep.c:727 [inline] register_lock_class+0x14e5/0x1ba0 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:753 __lock_acquire+0x187/0x3750 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:3303 lock_acquire+0x124/0x340 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:3907 __raw_spin_lock include/linux/spinlock_api_smp.h:142 [inline] _raw_spin_lock+0x32/0x50 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:144 spin_lock include/linux/spinlock.h:329 [inline] rp2_ch_interrupt drivers/tty/serial/rp2.c:466 [inline] rp2_asic_interrupt.isra.9+0x15d/0x990 drivers/tty/serial/rp2.c:493 rp2_uart_interrupt+0x49/0xe0 drivers/tty/serial/rp2.c:504 __handle_irq_event_percpu+0xfb/0x770 kernel/irq/handle.c:149 handle_irq_event_percpu+0x79/0x150 kernel/irq/handle.c:189 handle_irq_event+0xac/0x140 kernel/irq/handle.c:206 handle_fasteoi_irq+0x232/0x5c0 kernel/irq/chip.c:725 generic_handle_irq_desc include/linux/irqdesc.h:155 [inline] handle_irq+0x230/0x3a0 arch/x86/kernel/irq_64.c:87 do_IRQ+0xa7/0x1e0 arch/x86/kernel/irq.c:247 common_interrupt+0xf/0xf arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:670 </IRQ>RIP: 0010:native_safe_halt+0x28/0x30 arch/x86/include/asm/irqflags.h:61Code: 00 00 55 be 04 00 00 00 48 c7 c7 00 c2 2f 8c 48 89 e5 e8 fb 31 e7 f88b 05 75 af 8d 03 85 c0 7e 07 0f 00 2d 8a 61 65 00 fb f4 <5d> c3 90 90 9090 90 90 0f 1f 44 00 00 55 48 89 e5 41 57 41 56 41RSP: 0018:ffff88806b71fcc8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffdeRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffffff8bde7e48 RCX: ffffffff88a21285RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: 0000000000000004 RDI: ffffffff8c2fc200RBP: ffff88806b71fcc8 R08: fffffbfff185f840 R09: fffffbfff185f840R10: 0000000000000001 R11: fffffbfff185f840 R12: 0000000000000002R13: ffffffff8bea18a0 R14: 0000000000000000 R15: 0000000000000000 arch_safe_halt arch/x86/include/asm/paravirt.h:94 [inline] default_idle+0x6f/0x360 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:557 arch_cpu_idle+0xf/0x20 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:548 default_idle_call+0x3b/0x60 kernel/sched/idle.c:93 cpuidle_idle_call kernel/sched/idle.c:153 [inline] do_idle+0x2ab/0x3c0 kernel/sched/idle.c:263 cpu_startup_entry+0xcb/0xe0 kernel/sched/idle.c:369 start_secondary+0x3b8/0x4e0 arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:271 secondary_startup_64+0xa4/0xb0 arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S:243BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010PGD 8000000056d27067 P4D 8000000056d27067 PUD 56d28067 PMD 0Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTICPU: 2 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/2 Not tainted 4.19.177-gdba4159c14ef-dirty #45Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.12.0-59-gc9ba5276e321-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014RIP: 0010:readl arch/x86/include/asm/io.h:59 [inline]RIP: 0010:rp2_ch_interrupt drivers/tty/serial/rp2.c:472 [inline]RIP: 0010:rp2_asic_interrupt.isra.9+0x181/0x990 drivers/tty/serial/rp2.c:493Co---truncated---",2024-03-25T13:47:14.087,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-47169

CVE-2021-26932,3.6,Repo,"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used by Xen. Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver then loops over the results, performing follow-up actions based on the success or failure of each operation. Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable.

In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories",2024-03-27T12:29:41.530,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-29735

A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in memory.",2024-03-27T15:12:59.917,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-22901

To service requests to the PV backend, the driver maps grant references provided by the frontend. In this process, errors may be encountered. In one case, an error encountered earlier might be discarded by later processing, resulting in the caller assuming successful mapping, and hence subsequent operations trying to access space that wasn't mapped. In another case, internal state would be insufficiently updated, preventing safe recovery from the error.

Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a plain bug, deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially being at least under the influence of guests (such as out of memory conditions), it isn't correct to assume a plain bug. Memory allocations potentially causing such crashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though.

CVE-2021-26932,3.6,Xen,"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as used by Xen. Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls, where a number of operations are done in a single hypercall, the success or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver, and the backend driver then loops over the results, performing follow-up actions based on the success or failure of each operation. Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable.
