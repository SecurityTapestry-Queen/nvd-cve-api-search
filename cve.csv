The igate mutex cannot be acquired from theatomic context of the eventfd wake function.

In affected versions unauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /dashboard/snapshot/:key, or /api/snapshots/:key.

Regardless of the snapshot ""public_mode"" setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, or /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. The combination of deletion and viewing enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting in complete snapshot data loss. This issue has been resolved in versions 8.1.6 and 7.5.11.

CVE-2022-46169,5.9,Management,"Cacti is an open source platform which provides a robust and extensible operational monitoring and fault management framework for users. In affected versions a command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns `true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check because of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely on a productive instance because this action is added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`.This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first release containing the patch.",2024-06-28T13:43:32.350,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-46169

CVE-2024-5535,NA,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with anempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents tobe sent to the peer.Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequencessuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issuecould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sentto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applicationsthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list ofsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally neverbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur byaccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the callingapplication.The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLSapplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised andis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly morewidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list ofprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returnsthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in theclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns thefirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlapbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto iscalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition andreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reportsthat there was no overlap in the lists).This function is typically called from a server side application callback forALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the listof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero inlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should nevernormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if theSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the listsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then theapplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application hasaccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and hasaccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_lenparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap""response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then itwill be vulnerable to this problem.In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically selecta protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocolin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comesfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with aclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If theapplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss ofconfidentiality will occur.This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are mostlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is notwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making activeexploitation unlikely.The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases ofOpenSSL at this time.

CVE-2022-46169,5.9,PHP,"Cacti is an open source platform which provides a robust and extensible operational monitoring and fault management framework for users. In affected versions a command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns `true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check because of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely on a productive instance because this action is added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`.This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first release containing the patch.",2024-06-28T13:43:32.350,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2022-46169

CVE-2024-2965,3.6,Python,"A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `SitemapLoader` class of the `langchain-community` package, affecting all versions. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent infinite recursion when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability of services relying on this functionality.",2024-06-25T11:15:49.873,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-2965

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloningwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files.

CVE-2024-5535,NA,SSL,"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with anempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents tobe sent to the peer.Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequencessuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issuecould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sentto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applicationsthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list ofsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally neverbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur byaccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the callingapplication.The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLSapplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised andis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly morewidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list ofprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returnsthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in theclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns thefirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlapbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto iscalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition andreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reportsthat there was no overlap in the lists).This function is typically called from a server side application callback forALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the listof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero inlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should nevernormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if theSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the listsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then theapplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application hasaccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and hasaccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_lenparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap""response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then itwill be vulnerable to this problem.In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically selecta protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocolin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comesfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with aclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If theapplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss ofconfidentiality will occur.This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are mostlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is notwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making activeexploitation unlikely.The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases ofOpenSSL at this time.

CVE-2023-52489,NA,Snapdragon,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section->usageThe below race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memoryregion with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL].  Since normal zone start and endpfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggeredwill try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in NOP(becausepfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory sections).  Whenfrom other core, the section mappings are being removed for theZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on whichcompaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crashwith CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled.

However, because ofthe order in which things are initialised, this is not guaranteed to be thecase, because the device is exposed to the USB subsystem before the ath9k driverinitialisation is completed.We already committed a partial fix for this in commit:8b3046abc99e (""ath9k_htc: fix NULL pointer dereference at ath9k_htc_tx_get_packet()"")However, that commit only aborted the WMI_TXSTATUS_EVENTID command in the eventtasklet, pairing it with an ""initialisation complete"" bit in the TX struct. Itseems syzbot managed to trigger the race for one of the other commands as well,so let's just move the existing synchronisation bit to cover the wholetasklet (setting it at the end of ath9k_htc_probe_device() instead of insideath9k_tx_init()).",2024-06-25T23:15:27.180,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26897

CVE-2024-26687,NA,Xen,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanupshutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking theirq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Bothare called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.This opens multiple races:- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event  channel:  CPU0                        CPU1  shutdown_pirq {    xen_evtchn_close(e)                              __startup_pirq {                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)                              }    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)    }  }  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel  number.  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.The fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the eventchannel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it'spotential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the eventchannel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMedevices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irqis called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race duringboot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq andstartup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.  ------------[ cut here ]------------  blkfront: xvda: barrier or flush: disabled; persistent grants: enabled; indirect descriptors: enabled; bounce buffer: enabled  kernel BUG at drivers/xen/events/events_base.c:499!  invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI  CPU: 44 PID: 375 Comm: kworker/u257:23 Not tainted 5.10.201-191.748.amzn2.x86_64 #1  Hardware name: Xen HVM domU, BIOS 4.11.amazon 08/24/2006  Workqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work  RIP: 0010:bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0  Code: 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc 44 89 f7 e8 2b 55 ad ff 49 89 c5 48 85 c0 0f 84 64 ff ff ff 4c 8b 68 30 41 83 fe ff 0f 85 60 ff ff ff <0f> 0b 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 40 00 0f 1f 44 00 00  RSP: 0000:ffffc9000d533b08 EFLAGS: 00010046  RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: 0000000000000006  RDX: 0000000000000028 RSI: 00000000ffffffff RDI: 00000000ffffffff  RBP: ffff888107419680 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffffff82d72b00  R10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: 00000000000001ed  R13: 0000000000000000 R14: 00000000ffffffff R15: 0000000000000002  FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88bc8b500000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033  CR2: 0000000000000000 CR3: 0000000002610001 CR4: 00000000001706e0  DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000  DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400  Call Trace:   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? show_trace_log_lvl+0x1c1/0x2d9   ? set_affinity_irq+0xdc/0x1c0   ? __die_body.cold+0x8/0xd   ? die+0x2b/0x50   ? do_trap+0x90/0x110   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0xf0   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x12/0x20   ? bind_evtchn_to_cpu+0xdf/0x---truncated---",2024-06-25T22:15:20.917,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26687
CVE-2024-26816,NA,Xen,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86, relocs: Ignore relocations in .notes sectionWhen building with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted intothe .notes section so that Xen can find the ""startup_xen"" entry point.This information is used prior to booting the kernel, so relocationsare not useful. In fact, performing relocations against the .notessection means that the KASLR base is exposed since /sys/kernel/notesis world-readable.To avoid leaking the KASLR base without breaking unprivileged tools thatare expecting to read /sys/kernel/notes, skip performing relocations inthe .notes section.

CVE-2021-4440,NA,Xen,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:x86/xen: Drop USERGS_SYSRET64 paravirt callcommit afd30525a659ac0ae0904f0cb4a2ca75522c3123 upstream.USERGS_SYSRET64 is used to return from a syscall via SYSRET, buta Xen PV guest will nevertheless use the IRET hypercall, as thereis no sysret PV hypercall defined.So instead of testing all the prerequisites for doing a sysret andthen mangling the stack for Xen PV again for doing an iret just usethe iret exit from the beginning.This can easily be done via an ALTERNATIVE like it is done for thesysenter compat case already.It should be noted that this drops the optimization in Xen for notrestoring a few registers when returning to user mode, but it seemsas if the saved instructions in the kernel more than compensate forthis drop (a kernel build in a Xen PV guest was slightly faster withthis patch applied).While at it remove the stale sysret32 remnants.
