CVE-2024-27309,5.2,Apache,"While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug:1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.When those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.",2024-07-09T16:22:21.487,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-27309

CVE-2024-40927,NA,Apple,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:xhci: Handle TD clearing for multiple streams caseWhen multiple streams are in use, multiple TDs might be in flight whenan endpoint is stopped. We need to issue a Set TR Dequeue Pointer foreach, to ensure everything is reset properly and the caches cleared.Change the logic so that any N>1 TDs found active for different streamsare deferred until after the first one is processed, callingxhci_invalidate_cancelled_tds() again from xhci_handle_cmd_set_deq() toqueue another command until we are done with all of them. Also changethe error/""should never happen"" paths to ensure we at least clear anyaffected TDs, even if we can't issue a command to clear the hardwarecache, and complain loudly with an xhci_warn() if this ever happens.This problem case dates back to commit e9df17eb1408 (""USB: xhci: Correctassumptions about number of rings per endpoint."") early on in the XHCIdriver's life, when stream support was first added.It was then identified but not fixed nor made into a warning in commit674f8438c121 (""xhci: split handling halted endpoints into two steps""),which added a FIXME comment for the problem case (without materiallychanging the behavior as far as I can tell, though the new logic madethe problem more obvious).Then later, in commit 94f339147fc3 (""xhci: Fix failure to give back somecached cancelled URBs.""), it was acknowledged again.[Mathias: commit 94f339147fc3 (""xhci: Fix failure to give back some cachedcancelled URBs."") was a targeted regression fix to the previously mentionedpatch. Users reported issues with usb stuck after unmounting/disconnectingUAS devices. This rolled back the TD clearing of multiple streams to itsoriginal state.]Apparently the commit author was aware of the problem (yet still choseto submit it): It was still mentioned as a FIXME, an xhci_dbg() wasadded to log the problem condition, and the remaining issue was mentionedin the commit description. The choice of making the log type xhci_dbg()for what is, at this point, a completely unhandled and known brokencondition is puzzling and unfortunate, as it guarantees that no actualusers would see the log in production, thereby making it nighundebuggable (indeed, even if you turn on DEBUG, the message doesn'treally hint at there being a problem at all).It took me *months* of random xHC crashes to finally find a reliablerepro and be able to do a deep dive debug session, which could all havebeen avoided had this unhandled, broken condition been actually reportedwith a warning, as it should have been as a bug intentionally left inunfixed (never mind that it shouldn't have been left in at all).> Another fix to solve clearing the caches of all stream rings with> cancelled TDs is needed, but not as urgent.3 years after that statement and 14 years after the original bug wasintroduced, I think it's finally time to fix it. And maybe next timelet's not leave bugs unfixed (that are actually worse than the originalbug), and let's actually get people to review kernel commits please.Fixes xHC crashes and IOMMU faults with UAS devices when handlingerrors/faults. Easiest repro is to use `hdparm` to mark an early sector(e.g. 1024) on a disk as bad, then `cat /dev/sdX > /dev/null` in a loop.At least in the case of JMicron controllers, the read errors end uphaving to cancel two TDs (for two queued requests to different streams)and the one that didn't get cleared properly ends up faulting the xHCentirely when it tries to access DMA pages that have since been unmapped,referred to by the stale TDs. This normally happens quickly (after twoor three loops). After this fix, I left the `cat` in a loop runningovernight and experienced no xHC failures, with all read errorsrecovered properly. Repro'd and tested on an Apple M1 Mac Mini(dwc3 host).On systems without an IOMMU, this bug would instead silently corruptfreed memory, making this a---truncated---",2024-07-12T16:34:58.687,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-40927

This means the underlyingdoubly-linked list is temporarily inconsistent, page->prev->next orpage->next->prev might not be equal back to page for some page in thering buffer.The resize operation in ring_buffer_resize() can be invoked in parallel.It calls rb_check_pages() which can detect the described inconsistencyand stop further tracing:[  190.271762] ------------[ cut here ]------------[  190.271771] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6186 at kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:1467 rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0[  190.271789] Modules linked in: [...][  190.271991] Unloaded tainted modules: intel_uncore_frequency(E):1 skx_edac(E):1[  190.272002] CPU: 1 PID: 6186 Comm: cmd.sh Kdump: loaded Tainted: G            E      6.9.0-rc6-default #5 158d3e1e6d0b091c34c3b96bfd99a1c58306d79f[  190.272011] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552c-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014[  190.272015] RIP: 0010:rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0[  190.272023] Code: [...][  190.272028] RSP: 0018:ffff9c37463abb70 EFLAGS: 00010206[  190.272034] RAX: ffff8eba04b6cb80 RBX: 0000000000000007 RCX: ffff8eba01f13d80[  190.272038] RDX: ffff8eba01f130c0 RSI: ffff8eba04b6cd00 RDI: ffff8eba0004c700[  190.272042] RBP: ffff8eba0004c700 R08: 0000000000010002 R09: 0000000000000000[  190.272045] R10: 00000000ffff7f52 R11: ffff8eba7f600000 R12: ffff8eba0004c720[  190.272049] R13: ffff8eba00223a00 R14: 0000000000000008 R15: ffff8eba067a8000[  190.272053] FS:  00007f1bd64752c0(0000) GS:ffff8eba7f680000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000[  190.272057] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[  190.272061] CR2: 00007f1bd6662590 CR3: 000000010291e001 CR4: 0000000000370ef0[  190.272070] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000[  190.272073] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400[  190.272077] Call Trace:[  190.272098]  <TASK>[  190.272189]  ring_buffer_resize+0x2ab/0x460[  190.272199]  __tracing_resize_ring_buffer.part.0+0x23/0xa0[  190.272206]  tracing_resize_ring_buffer+0x65/0x90[  190.272216]  tracing_entries_write+0x74/0xc0[  190.272225]  vfs_write+0xf5/0x420[  190.272248]  ksys_write+0x67/0xe0[  190.272256]  do_syscall_64+0x82/0x170[  190.272363]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e[  190.272373] RIP: 0033:0x7f1bd657d263[  190.272381] Code: [...][  190.272385] RSP: 002b:00007ffe72b643f8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001[  190.272391] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 00007f1bd657d263[  190.272395] RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000555a6eb538e0 RDI: 0000000000000001[  190.272398] RBP: 0000555a6eb538e0 R08: 000000000000000a R09: 0000000000000000[  190.272401] R10: 0000555a6eb55190 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007f1bd6662500[  190.272404] R13: 0000000000000002 R14: 00007f1bd6667c00 R15: 0000000000000002[  190.272412]  </TASK>[  190.272414] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---Note that ring_buffer_resize() calls rb_check_pages() only if the parenttrace_buffer has recording disabled.

CVE-2024-5535,5.2,OpenSSL,"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with anempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents tobe sent to the peer.Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequencessuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issuecould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sentto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applicationsthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list ofsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally neverbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur byaccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the callingapplication.The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLSapplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised andis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly morewidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list ofprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returnsthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in theclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns thefirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlapbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto iscalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition andreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reportsthat there was no overlap in the lists).This function is typically called from a server side application callback forALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the listof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero inlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should nevernormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if theSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the listsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then theapplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application hasaccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and hasaccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_lenparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap""response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then itwill be vulnerable to this problem.In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically selecta protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocolin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comesfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with aclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If theapplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss ofconfidentiality will occur.This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are mostlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is notwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making activeexploitation unlikely.The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases ofOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when theybecome available.",2024-07-12T14:15:16.790,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-5535

Following that, if the operation is successful,old->list.next->prev gets updated too. This means the underlyingdoubly-linked list is temporarily inconsistent, page->prev->next orpage->next->prev might not be equal back to page for some page in thering buffer.The resize operation in ring_buffer_resize() can be invoked in parallel.It calls rb_check_pages() which can detect the described inconsistencyand stop further tracing:[  190.271762] ------------[ cut here ]------------[  190.271771] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6186 at kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c:1467 rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0[  190.271789] Modules linked in: [...][  190.271991] Unloaded tainted modules: intel_uncore_frequency(E):1 skx_edac(E):1[  190.272002] CPU: 1 PID: 6186 Comm: cmd.sh Kdump: loaded Tainted: G            E      6.9.0-rc6-default #5 158d3e1e6d0b091c34c3b96bfd99a1c58306d79f[  190.272011] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552c-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014[  190.272015] RIP: 0010:rb_check_pages.isra.0+0x6a/0xa0[  190.272023] Code: [...][  190.272028] RSP: 0018:ffff9c37463abb70 EFLAGS: 00010206[  190.272034] RAX: ffff8eba04b6cb80 RBX: 0000000000000007 RCX: ffff8eba01f13d80[  190.272038] RDX: ffff8eba01f130c0 RSI: ffff8eba04b6cd00 RDI: ffff8eba0004c700[  190.272042] RBP: ffff8eba0004c700 R08: 0000000000010002 R09: 0000000000000000[  190.272045] R10: 00000000ffff7f52 R11: ffff8eba7f600000 R12: ffff8eba0004c720[  190.272049] R13: ffff8eba00223a00 R14: 0000000000000008 R15: ffff8eba067a8000[  190.272053] FS:  00007f1bd64752c0(0000) GS:ffff8eba7f680000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000[  190.272057] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033[  190.272061] CR2: 00007f1bd6662590 CR3: 000000010291e001 CR4: 0000000000370ef0[  190.272070] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000[  190.272073] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400[  190.272077] Call Trace:[  190.272098]  <TASK>[  190.272189]  ring_buffer_resize+0x2ab/0x460[  190.272199]  __tracing_resize_ring_buffer.part.0+0x23/0xa0[  190.272206]  tracing_resize_ring_buffer+0x65/0x90[  190.272216]  tracing_entries_write+0x74/0xc0[  190.272225]  vfs_write+0xf5/0x420[  190.272248]  ksys_write+0x67/0xe0[  190.272256]  do_syscall_64+0x82/0x170[  190.272363]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e[  190.272373] RIP: 0033:0x7f1bd657d263[  190.272381] Code: [...][  190.272385] RSP: 002b:00007ffe72b643f8 EFLAGS: 00000246 ORIG_RAX: 0000000000000001[  190.272391] RAX: ffffffffffffffda RBX: 0000000000000002 RCX: 00007f1bd657d263[  190.272395] RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0000555a6eb538e0 RDI: 0000000000000001[  190.272398] RBP: 0000555a6eb538e0 R08: 000000000000000a R09: 0000000000000000[  190.272401] R10: 0000555a6eb55190 R11: 0000000000000246 R12: 00007f1bd6662500[  190.272404] R13: 0000000000000002 R14: 00007f1bd6667c00 R15: 0000000000000002[  190.272412]  </TASK>[  190.272414] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---Note that ring_buffer_resize() calls rb_check_pages() only if the parenttrace_buffer has recording disabled.

CVE-2024-2746,6.0,Repository,"Incomplete fix for CVE-2024-1929The problem with CVE-2024-1929 was that the dnf5 D-Bus daemon accepted arbitrary configuration parameters from unprivileged users, which allowed alocal root exploit by tricking the daemon into loading a user controlled ""plugin"". All of this happened before Polkit authentication was even started.The dnf5 library code does not check whether non-root users control the directory in question. On one hand, this poses a Denial-of-Service attack vector by making the daemonoperate on a blocking file (e.g. named FIFO special file) or a very large filethat causes an out-of-memory situation (e.g. /dev/zero). On the other hand, this can be used to let the daemon process privileged files like /etc/shadow.The file in question is parsed as an INI file. Error diagnostics resulting from parsing privileged files could cause information leaks, if these diagnosticsare accessible to unprivileged users. In the case of libdnf5, no such user accessible diagnostics should exist, though.Also, a local attacker can place a valid repository configuration file in this directory.

CVE-2024-5535,5.2,SSL,"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with anempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents tobe sent to the peer.Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequencessuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issuecould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sentto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applicationsthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list ofsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally neverbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur byaccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the callingapplication.The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLSapplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised andis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly morewidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list ofprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returnsthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in theclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns thefirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlapbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto iscalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition andreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reportsthat there was no overlap in the lists).This function is typically called from a server side application callback forALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the listof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero inlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should nevernormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if theSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the listsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then theapplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application hasaccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and hasaccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_lenparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap""response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then itwill be vulnerable to this problem.In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically selecta protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocolin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comesfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with aclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If theapplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss ofconfidentiality will occur.This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are mostlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is notwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making activeexploitation unlikely.The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases ofOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when theybecome available.",2024-07-12T14:15:16.790,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-5535

CVE-2024-5535,5.2,TLS,"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with anempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents tobe sent to the peer.Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequencessuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issuecould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sentto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applicationsthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list ofsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally neverbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur byaccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the callingapplication.The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLSapplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised andis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly morewidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list ofprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returnsthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in theclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns thefirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlapbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto iscalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition andreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reportsthat there was no overlap in the lists).This function is typically called from a server side application callback forALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the listof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero inlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should nevernormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if theSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the listsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then theapplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application hasaccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and hasaccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_lenparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap""response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then itwill be vulnerable to this problem.In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically selecta protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocolin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comesfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with aclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If theapplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss ofconfidentiality will occur.This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are mostlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is notwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making activeexploitation unlikely.The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases ofOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when theybecome available.",2024-07-12T14:15:16.790,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-5535

CVE-2024-31076,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:genirq/cpuhotplug, x86/vector: Prevent vector leak during CPU offlineThe absence of IRQD_MOVE_PCNTXT prevents immediate effectiveness ofinterrupt affinity reconfiguration via procfs. Instead, the change isdeferred until the next instance of the interrupt being triggered on theoriginal CPU.When the interrupt next triggers on the original CPU, the new affinity isenforced within __irq_move_irq(). A vector is allocated from the new CPU,but the old vector on the original CPU remains and is not immediatelyreclaimed. Instead, apicd->move_in_progress is flagged, and the reclaimingprocess is delayed until the next trigger of the interrupt on the new CPU.Upon the subsequent triggering of the interrupt on the new CPU,irq_complete_move() adds a task to the old CPU's vector_cleanup list if itremains online. Subsequently, the timer on the old CPU iterates over itsvector_cleanup list, reclaiming old vectors.However, a rare scenario arises if the old CPU is outgoing before theinterrupt triggers again on the new CPU.In that case irq_force_complete_move() is not invoked on the outgoing CPUto reclaim the old apicd->prev_vector because the interrupt isn't currentlyaffine to the outgoing CPU, and irq_needs_fixup() returns false. Eventhough __vector_schedule_cleanup() is later called on the new CPU, itdoesn't reclaim apicd->prev_vector; instead, it simply resets bothapicd->move_in_progress and apicd->prev_vector to 0.As a result, the vector remains unreclaimed in vector_matrix, leading to aCPU vector leak.To address this issue, move the invocation of irq_force_complete_move()before the irq_needs_fixup() call to reclaim apicd->prev_vector, if theinterrupt is currently or used to be affine to the outgoing CPU.Additionally, reclaim the vector in __vector_schedule_cleanup() as well,following a warning message, although theoretically it should never seeapicd->move_in_progress with apicd->prev_cpu pointing to an offline CPU.",2024-07-15T07:15:03.810,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-31076
