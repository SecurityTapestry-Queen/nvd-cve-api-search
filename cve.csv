CVE-2024-29735,NA,Airflow,"Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories",2024-05-01T19:15:23.573,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-29735

CVE-2023-48795,3.6,Apache,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Then, we shouldrather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of theGT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref longenough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is releasedand the GT parked.I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() froma dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by abug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's activeintel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on thatintel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as theVMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goesidle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, useasync variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),    - using async variant of _put(),    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and    there is no other good place for that.

CVE-2023-27359,5.9,Firewall,TP-Link AX1800 hotplugd Firewall Rule Race Condition Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain access to LAN-side services on affected installations of TP-Link Archer AX21 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the hotplugd daemon. The issue results from firewall rule handling that allows an attacker access to resources that should be available to the LAN interface only. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the root user.

CVE-2023-48795,3.6,Golang,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter, it was possible to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path.                                         This means that if the datasource was configured by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ ), it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues queries containing path traversal characters, which would in turn cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/) https://example.com/api/admin_api/) .In the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana instance itself, this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe, as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials, resulting in the potential for privilege escalation, hence the high score for this vulnerability.",2024-05-03T13:15:20.927,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-5123

Thus the contents of some of these vector registersare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used.

CVE-2024-32971,6.0,Redis,"Apollo Router is a configurable, graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. The affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that in limited circumstances, could lead to unexpected operations being executed which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. The root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router’s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors. The issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary. For a query, results may be fetched that don’t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`. For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`. Users who are using distributed query plan caching, are advised to either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 are not recommended for use and have been withdrawn.

CVE-2023-48795,3.6,SSH,"The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers.

CVE-2023-6129,4.2,TLS,"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementationcontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications runningon PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MACalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with variousapplication dependent consequences.The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL forPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different orderthan they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registersare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used onlyon newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption canbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does notdepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worstconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the applicationprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storingpointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect resultof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial ofservice.The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of theCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocolversions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a maliciousclient can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies thatTLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. Howeverwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affectedby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.",2024-05-03T13:15:21.163,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2023-6129

CVE-2024-24806,3.4,Windows,"libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",2024-05-01T18:15:14.987,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-24806
CVE-2024-24576,6.0,Windows,"Rust is a programming language. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.The `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.On Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.One exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an `InvalidInput` error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.The fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.

CVE-2024-26991,NA,X86,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:KVM: x86/mmu: x86: Don't overflow lpage_info when checking attributesFix KVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES to not overflow lpage_info array and triggerKASAN splat, as seen in the private_mem_conversions_test selftest.When memory attributes are set on a GFN range, that range will havespecific properties applied to the TDP. A huge page cannot be used whenthe attributes are inconsistent, so they are disabled for those thespecific huge pages. For internal KVM reasons, huge pages are also notallowed to span adjacent memslots regardless of whether the backing memorycould be mapped as huge.What GFNs support which huge page sizes is tracked by an array of arrays'lpage_info' on the memslot, of ‘kvm_lpage_info’ structs. Each index oflpage_info contains a vmalloc allocated array of these for a specificsupported page size. The kvm_lpage_info denotes whether a specific hugepage (GFN and page size) on the memslot is supported. These arrays includeindices for unaligned head and tail huge pages.Preventing huge pages from spanning adjacent memslot is covered byincrementing the count in head and tail kvm_lpage_info when the memslot isallocated, but disallowing huge pages for memory that has mixed attributeshas to be done in a more complicated way. During theKVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES ioctl KVM updates lpage_info for each memslot inthe range that has mismatched attributes. KVM does this a memslot at atime, and marks a special bit, KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG, in the kvm_lpage_infofor any huge page. This bit is essentially a permanently elevated count.So huge pages will not be mapped for the GFN at that page size if thecount is elevated in either case: a huge head or tail page unaligned tothe memslot or if KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is set because it has mixedattributes.To determine whether a huge page has consistent attributes, theKVM_SET_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTES operation checks an xarray to make sure itconsistently has the incoming attribute. Since level - 1 huge pages arealigned to level huge pages, it employs an optimization. As long as thelevel - 1 huge pages are checked first, it can just check these and assumethat if each level - 1 huge page contained within the level sized hugepage is not mixed, then the level size huge page is not mixed. Thisoptimization happens in the helper hugepage_has_attrs().Unfortunately, although the kvm_lpage_info array representing page size'level' will contain an entry for an unaligned tail page of size level,the array for level - 1  will not contain an entry for each GFN at pagesize level. The level - 1 array will only contain an index for anyunaligned region covered by level - 1 huge page size, which can be asmaller region. So this causes the optimization to overflow the level - 1kvm_lpage_info and perform a vmalloc out of bounds read.In some cases of head and tail pages where an overflow could happen,callers skip the operation completely as KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG is notrequired to prevent huge pages as discussed earlier. But for memslots thatare smaller than the 1GB page size, it does call hugepage_has_attrs(). Inthis case the huge page is both the head and tail page. The issue can beobserved simply by compiling the kernel with CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC andrunning the selftest “private_mem_conversions_test”, which produces theoutput like the following:BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in hugepage_has_attrs+0x7e/0x110Read of size 4 at addr ffffc900000a3008 by task private_mem_con/169Call Trace:  dump_stack_lvl  print_report  ? __virt_addr_valid  ? hugepage_has_attrs  ? hugepage_has_attrs  kasan_report  ? hugepage_has_attrs  hugepage_has_attrs  kvm_arch_post_set_memory_attributes  kvm_vm_ioctlIt is a little ambiguous whether the unaligned head page (in the bug casealso the tail page) should be expected to have KVM_LPAGE_MIXED_FLAG set.It is not functionally required, as the unal---truncated---",2024-05-03T03:16:27.407,https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2024-26991
